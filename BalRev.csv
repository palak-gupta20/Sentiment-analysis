"1",2,"Drinks were great as was the bartender.  Then there was the bar food. Had to return the calamari it was so bad.  Like eating a rubber band.  Brought us a second plate...it was worse than the first.  Tacos were extremely seasoned with hot sauce. What happened to this place? I used to love it and now the restaurant is empty. Sad.",-1
"2",1,"I would give this zero stars if that was an option. Awful customer service I ordered calamari and it was the worse calamari EVER. Half wasn't cooked there were deep fried pepperoncini I in it which was un eatable and so fried it looked like a shell of some sort. The calamari it's self was rubbery and half wasn't even cooked. When I took it back the waitress she didn't even come greet me she just said everyone loves pepperoncini. Listen to all these one stars reviews they are correct, I tried to give it a shot and it sucked.",-1
"3",1,"Filthy n terrible customer service. I stood there for almost 10 min waiting for my cup for my drink. Never again! I had no where to eat because of no clean tables.",-1
"4",1,"Rating: 0.5/5 

I had high hopes for this place, especially after seeing its Zagat rating, but don't be fooled by it! After trying it out, however, I feel compelled to add some truth to these hyped-up reviews here on Yelp. 

1. Wait: We made a reservation for 8pm and arrived promptly and on-time. We were greeted by a hostess that told us ""I'm sorry, but the patrons at your table are still finishing up their conversation"", then proceeded to make us wait for an extra 20 minutes. Wow. Seriously. Wow. I've been to many high-end places all over the country and I don't think I've ever experienced a level of pretentiousness and wanna-be ness as Uchiko. A reservation means I get to sit down at the table immediately as I have called ahead of time to serve a place. And please don't use that phrase ""finish up a conversation"", it just makes your establishment disgustingly and nauseatingly smug. If there's anything I hate, it's people who don't value other people's time. It's extremely inconsiderate and unprofessional. 

2. Once we finally got a table, our waitress took quite a while to come back to us. Water / was not even offered until 15 minutes after we were handed menus and greeted. 

3. Menu: Where do I start on this atrocity? The menu was poorly written and designed. Just a list of ingredients that go into the dishes with no explanation of the type of dishes (appetizer, tapas, etc.) whatsoever an what the dishes mean. I get the feeling that whoever made it intended it to be minimalist, cool and trendy, but having 3 separate menu pieces that are badly explained and disjointed was a very frustrating experience. Having an unattentive waiter didn't help either. When she finally came over, she basically had to describe everything on the menu and did not do a very good job of articulating the differences between each one. Case in point: everything becomes more pleasurable and efficient when you take the time to describe the menu for your guests, not slap together some sparse- looking white pages that were clearly designed to just look beautiful but are pretty much useless from a utilitarian standpoint. 

4. Atmosphere: Loud, dark, rather chaotic and busy. Made me feel like I was eating in a mess hall. Felt like a place where you go to be seen, rather than a place to enjoy truly good food. 

5. Meal: The biggest shocker. Overall, quite mediocre. I don't mind paying a lot for tiny portions when they are absolutely and stunningly delicious. I paid $20 for just a piece of mackerel smaller than the size of my palm that tasted bland and fishy. In Japan, mackerels are one of the cheapest fishes available. Got the $20 seabass,again, with high hopes but it tasted even worse than the mackerel. Rolls were nothing to shout about for the price and quantity offered. There wasn't even miso soup on the menu. I get that this restaurant is trying to offer a new spin on Japanese, but I suspect that the only reason why it wasn't on the menu was because they couldn't charge $10 for it. The thing we disliked the least was the fried eggplant slices, which require no skill to make. Confusion runs rampant among the staff. They kept bringing us dishes we didn't even order and we had to send back 3 dishes to the kitchen. For the hefty price we paid, we were completely unimpressed with the below average food, slow and bad service and were left hungry after our meal, which took 2 hours to finish. 

Conclusion: Do not go! Extremely turned off by the vibe and hype surrounding it, pretentious, smug service, lack of respect for my time and mediocre food.",-1

Five baristas and I still waited eight minutes to have an order taken, only one other customer in the shop.
Had to, of course go back and inquire about the croissant and wait again.
Tables were covered in debris and crumbs even though, five people and now only three customers. Just too busy I guess at 8:50 in the morning.
They need to fire everyone and start over.",-1
"8",1,"Service is pretty terrible, or better yet non-existent at this location. I came here during a busy time and b-lined to the garden section as I wanted to pick up some succulents to put something together. 

I walked aimlessly up and down, and up and down the whole garden area looking for succulents or anyone wearing an orange apron.  I eventually found some succulents but they were too mature for my liking.  I went up to the cashier area to ask for help - if they had more or other succulents and the cashier couldn't help me and told me to look for someone in the garden department. 

Again, went back to the garden department and didn't see any orange.  I ended up leaving feeling pretty deflated and empty handed.  That sucked and was a waste of time.",-1
"9",2,"Almost everything was way too salty. I wish I'd read reviews here first--clearly we are not the only ones who couldn't handle the salt factor. 

If the salt were balanced, it might make 4 stars -- I give them credit for inventiveness and presentation, I didn't find it overly expensive (for a fancy-pants place), and the service was good. That being said, we didn't find anything that we found inspiring....",-1
"10",2,"The south end whole food has been disappointing to say the least. I have been there four times. They are a bit better organized now but there is much to improve. The produce department needs to put their act together. Three people tried to help me find Arugula and could not! Very unhelpful and disorganized. Overall lack of courtesy and a could not care less attitude. Went to the meat department and asked for organic chicken tenders. If it is not there we do not have it. There is no desire to help or get the item for you. On the contrary I went to a new grocery store in downtown,the day of their opening .What a contrast! Personnel standing at different isles trying to help. A well organized family owned store who care for their customers. Since I live in downtown, it is convenient for me to use the South end Whole Foods. However I will go there less and less and spend my money somewhere , where they care for their customers.",-1

"12",1,"Disgusting is the first word that pops to mind for this place. I don't even know what i was thinking when I decided to step foot into this place. It's dirty with cockroaches everywhere. I felt like i won the lottery when the first seat we took and a freaking roach crawled up on the wall next to us. Barf much?! Should have been a sign to get up and leave. But my brain was no longer functioning and it was my stomach calling the shots. But once brain took over we got up to leave but by then we finished half our food and felt disgusted. 

I just don't know why in the world I didn't even look at the reviews when checking into this place. Stupid stomach. My brain is gonna call all the shots from now on.",-1

I use to come here often because we live in the neighborhood, but my girlfriend got a sandwich there one day, and we discovered mold on the cheese. never again will I come back here. As a microbiology major, mold on hard cheeses like that run the risk of listeria, brucella, salmonella and E. coli. how long was that cheese open? it has to be refrigerated when not in use right? I have the same cheese in my refrigerator that i have had for three weeks and it doesn't have any mold on it. makes me wonder what the bakery looks like. 

i wasn't a fan of the coffee nor the smell of some of the clientele either...",-1
"15",1,"Just a quick review about this place. When we arrived into Orlando our friends had heard great things about Ravenouse Pig. We made reservations to eat here right after landing. Parking is VERY limited, in fact, it's valet unless you can snag one of 8 spaces in the lot.

We started off at the bar since we arrived early. Selections of popular dishes passed us during the early part of the evening.  Once such appetizing item was their Pretzel Bread taleggio fondue: gruyere-chive biscuit/smoked salt butter . We were excited to try this dish once we met up with our friends for dinner. We ordered a few drinks at the bar including a special made lemon drop martini.

Once seated, the 'stars' started falling off my review. Our server was friendly but oh SO slow. We ordered the Pretzel Bread appetizer only to be told at 7:30pm on a Saturday evening that they RAN OUT. Our server provided us with some 'complimentary nuggets of bread'.  There were no full pieces just small bits of bread.  No refills were offered. The name of the place encouraged us to order the Pork Porterhouse, but guess what they RAN OUT.  We were all confused because the name suggests 'pork'.  I ended up with the Steak Frites while others ordered the Short Ribs and Tacos.  The food was good but not what we expected.

Service definitely was lacking. Again, our server was friendly but offered to no sense of urgency to anything.  The entire experience lasted close to 3.5 hours.  I'd re-think driving outside of Orlando if I came to visit again.",-1
"16",1,"Service was less than par! Waited for like 10 mins for the host then went to the bar to ask for one she came to said oh go where ever you want so we sat at the bar . The bartender seemed uninterested that we were there and wanted to have food and drinks . Food arrived and was great. No follow up on food  and waited over 20 mins to finally be asked if we wanted a drink and we then asked for the check ! Two people ended up don't it  not our original server. They come to ask us what we had then rings it up. We get the checks and as she is walking off ""not looking"" at us mumbles have a good night!


Very unimpressed with the visit and will take a lot to get me to return!",-1
"17",2,"I think that if you want authentic Mexican food, you should go elsewhere. If you want  Tex mex, you should also go elsewhere.. unfortunately it just wasn't good.. but they have good drinks. So I gave them a few stars.",-1

"19",2,"All I tried was a chocolate nutella croissant, and I wasn't nearly as into it as other reviewers. Mainly because it was almost $3 w/ tax and the croissant was dense and soggy. I have a feeling I got stuck with one that had been sitting out for a few days and/or weeks. Sad times! 

On the plus side, the list of menu items above the counter is both aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. So it's got that going for it, which is nice.",-1
"20",2,"I've been to Crave about 6 or 7 times now. Every time my GF and I leave, we can't help but ask ""Why did we come here again?"" Well, the only reasons why we hesitantly return is because they're open late and they're right in the heart of the drag. Their Pad Thai is good, but their sushi is mediocre. Their service is pretty bad too. Sometimes a hostess will be at the front door to seat you, sometimes not. One time a party of about 8 people waited around, sat themselves, then waited to be helped, and then left because not a single waiter came by. One good thing is if you have that UT Discount Card to get free sake, but that's about it. If you're looking for sushi close to campus, I'd suggest Sushi Nichii or for a happy hour - Kyoto.",-1
"21",2,"I was here last week after work for bubble tea craving. I've previously had wonderful experience at Metrotown location and expected the same at Aberdeen location as well.

I ordered Oolong Milk Tea for $3.80 (medium) and it was okay. I ordered half sugar with less ice by the way. My drink tastasted bland and bit too watery. Felt like waste of money.

It was so bad that he took a bite and wanted nothing to do with it.... this is a kid who loves ice cream. 
Very Disappointed in this last experience and a waste of money as we had to toss it.",-1
"25",1,"I'm a big fan of hot yoga and have experienced many different studios in the area, and this was by far one of my least favorite experiences. I'll say as a disclaimer, that the style of bikram yoga is new to me and I was expecting more of a classic flow for the class, but that aside, it was also far from motivating or centering. There's no music, the instructor's tone felt like an auctioneer, and he didn't provide any modifications for the more difficult poses, instead going right into them and saying multiple times that they should hurt. I've never heard an instructor say that. My body didn't feel nearly warmed up enough for most of them, and I was equal parts discouraged and worried I was going to hurt myself. The room itself is carpeted which is super gross, the ceiling fans were covered in grime and the heat/steam in the room seems to be provided by individual floor units so god help you if your mat ends up in front of one. The locker rooms are also super sub par- Carpeted, dirty, half the lockers are broken, there's no water fountain on the premises, and the only perk is that you can get super scratchy towels that you have to pay $1 for. If you're looking for a great hot yoga class, I'd head to CorePower Yoga instead.",-1
"26",1,"This is a long story I've cut very short and updated on August 24, 2011, 14 months after my treatment at Select Physical Therapy.  I visited Select Physical Therapy with a hand injury that was made much worse after my 2 visits with them.  My 1st visit was at the Austin Center Blvd location and my 2nd visit was at the Medical Parkway location.  

In retrospect, before I had my first appointment, my injury was quickly healing on its own and my symptoms were very minor compared to now.  But I asked Select Physical Therapy if they were right for me since I was concerned about healing completely.  The therapist said ""yes.""  Things I needed to get done in my life were coming up soon and I figured faster healing would also be a plus if done carefully.  

Briefly stated, I strictly followed home exercises that were given to me, but they have severely injured my hand and deeply traumatized my life much more than I can say here.  I communicated to their therapist that the exercise was painful, yet she encouraged me to continue them saying this is normal.  My hand is now completely unusable as even slight movements send excruciating pain, burning into my fingers  It has been 1 since 1 year since this appointment  and my hand is still very painful even after light work. 

Though highly recommended by the manager at the Austin Center Blvd location, my appointment at the Medical Parkway location was truly uncomfortable and further damaging.  When I attempted the exercises given to me at Medical Parkway, that was the last straw for my hand.  About 5 seconds of this therapeutic exercise at my home ended with cumulative damage that had been done to my hand from the 1st appointment and I was on my own after that.  My 2nd therapist tried to defend my 1st therapist, at which I interrupted her and she appeared to change her position. She then said she had actually counseled the Jr. therapist.  I hope this positively helps their organizatiron, though I've certainly had no healing from this.  As of June 2010, I injured my right hand also shortly after my treatment at Select Physical Therapy.  This was done one month after my treatment as I wasn't able to use my left hand for several months.  As of now, after a required surgery and a stay at a psychiatric hospital, both my hands are still quite painful after light use, such as washing dishes or driving.",-1
"27",1,"BUYER BEWARE. I ordered my daughters leotard online on 8/25 and paid for priority shipping. As of 9/10 I still have not received it. I emailed them twice to follow up and no response. I live in the same state, so how long should I expect to wait with no response??",-1

Cavalia (Cirque du Soleil) , 8pm.  Metrovino reservation, 6:15pm.  2 blocks from each other.  This is a very, very doable scenario, especially if you tell your waiter beforehand.  But....no.  

We start with the (duh) charcuterie plate.  Decent.  To be fair, I am to charcuterie plates as Jughead is to burgers.  If you want the real deal, go to Beast.  But I digress.  After we pound our meat, we nibble on some bread--which we come to find out costs $3.  Yep, you pay for bread here.  This is bad, but not quite as bad as our sneaky-ass waiter asking us in passing, ""would you care for some bread?""  Well shit dude, we have to ask? Yes, bring us some damn bread, for the love of God.  Wait, you're charging me for it?!  Suddenly I start looking suspiciously at my fork, water, napkin, salt.  What the fuck else did he sneak in here that we're getting charged for?
 
So we've got well over an hour to get served and start walking, so we sip our drinks and lose ourselves in conversation.  Then comes the wait.  You know that moment when you've waited so long that there is absolutely no higher priority than to get your waiters attention and ask him what the fuck is going on?  This period lasted 40 minutes.  I shit you not.  We were flagging down bussers and randoms.  Begging.  Pleading.  If I had a flare gun I'm confident that this guy would've missed it.  We'd been there over an hour and a half.

At 7:50pm we get our food.  In boxes.  I start shoveling my shrimp and risotto in my mouth as I walk.  Terrible.  The shrimp are mealy.  The risotto is under cooked and tastes like ammonia.  Whatever else was in there blended all together to form a white paste that made me think I'd interrupted some kind of shrimp circle jerk.  I pitched it.  Wife's steak was meh.  Shared with her to keep from starving.

Sorry Metrovino, but you fail.",-1
"30",1,"We will never go again!

Order:
Red wine, tasted like it went bad with a brownish tint
Crab cakes which were pure salt 
Main dishes for 4, soup was cold, baked potato was undercooked all meat was cold and chewy. They had 1 bottle of A1 sauce that was empty and rice was cold and no flavor, guess all the salt was used on crab cakes. Nicely told the waitress that potato was undercooked in which she replied awwww that sucks I look forward to a good potato and walked away. ....  hmmmm ok",-1

But that was completely rude and presumptuous.

My bf ordered sesame chicken and asked to get lo mein with it. The manager quickly cuts him off, and says that it only comes with rice. After we interjected, and SLOWLY explained the point was to PAY extra to eat what we preferred, she huffed that it would be $5 to add it on. Ok..? So? And? We paid, and after a few minutes we got our food.

I came in here with a group of friends on a Saturday afternoon. The place wasn't busy at all. We took a seat at one of the tables, and went to the bar to order drinks. We were informed that we needed to wait for the waitress to come around to us and couldn't order at the bar. Kind of odd, but we obliged. It took another 10 minutes for our waitress to show up - she seemed pissed when some of us asked for a menu, and had a serious attitude problem when someone asked about beer selections. You work at a pub, what the hell do you expect lady? She took drink orders, and the rest of us said we would order when she came back with drinks. Except, she never came back. We waited a good 15-20 minutes, and when one of us spotted her standing near the register chatting away with another employee like our table didn't even exist, we decided it was time to leave.

Careful not to break tooth on the hard sugar crystals...we actually thought we ran into a piece of plastic on the first bite.

"41",2,"Two months, no days off, 80-90 hr work weeks. Friends gave up, they are all mad, including my mom, haven't called her in 4 months... I never knew why I have such a hard time being a decent human being; you  know, politically correct, bright and shiny, good for society, mortgage, rrsps, social butterfly, smart kids, SUV, little money on very conservative mutual funds, a good Samaritan. I tried, believe it or not... 

Didn't quite work out. I was back to the jungle, doing whatever I want, whenever I want very shortly. It is not my choice, just like James Brown said ''it is what it is...''

I invited a friend out for her birthday and she was kind enough join me. Hopefully I still have some social skills left to keep her entertained. She mentioned Coast... Never been, why not, sure. 

One bad addiction of mine; I love christmas music. At first it comes across entertaining to people, but it is at a very annoying level. So I popped some christmas music on my ipod and hopped on my scooter to head down to the restaurant. I am dreaming of a white christmas. I know it is June, but the song was written in California by Irving, him dreaming of a snowy Chritsmas, at least that is what I was told.

First impression; kind of Joe Forte's without the Joe. You never get real good food out of this kinda joints. Usually decently executed, crowd pleasing, yet no real character...The hostess arrives with two menus, my company is not here yet, so I still have a little time to have my last panic attack and maybe listen to one last ""Santa Baby, by Madonna''.

The size of the menus are hilarious. They are real life size tablets. I am sitting in this tiny table with two giant, giant menus, feeling like Moses all ready. However you can not put them down, there are no space. How about wrapping these bad boys around your head and start a whirling dervish party. Each menu would yield to 2 medium size cone shaped dervish hat. For sure. Oh there is my company, be decent now, you do not need another woman with bad memories about you. I am haunted by bad karma enough all ready.

Well, let's get to the food. Too many selections... Flat breads and variety of salads, excessive choice of steaks...Bad bad signs of a great medium. We have ordered the sushi tile for two and scallops for entrees, bottle of beautiful Riesling. The sushi tile looked and tasted very appetizing with the exception of skin-on yellow tail sashimi -if I am not wrong- Sushi cooks would pour boiling water on the skin of the fish before serving just to soften it up and partially cook the skin with keeping the flesh raw, let's say a water baste. Very original to watch, however soggy fish skin is very unlikable for that size. Loup de mer, red mullet, anchovies and such I do not mind, but on this particular one, I had to chew through fish skin...Other than that, it is good.

Entree; Scallops with fennel, potatoes, olives and canned artichokes. Scallops, lack seasoning, excellent temperature though (except one, raw). I do not think they are alive fresh, but a very good quality frozen shellfish, which these days there is nothing wrong with it. The vegetable garnish I am not a big fan, which lemony seasoning (it was some from of beurre blanc if I am not mistaken) covers the flaws of it.

First things first I do not get the fascination of canned artichokes in this culture. That is a very hard vegetable to master to start with and the canned variety is not even a close substitute for the real thing. It is good for pizza or salads under $10. If I am paying $36 for an entree; either do not have it on your menu, or get a fresh one, clean, cook and serve appropriately. Putting canned artichoke is more like a tex-mex Mediterranean flair. At that price range, it does bother me.

And as far as the lightly grilled red pepper goes; some vegetables are not meant to be eaten crispy. Like eggplant, red pepper and such. As they roast and get soft, the natural sugars would work and transform these vegetables into something so incredibly delicious, that you would not imagine. There were two occasions my grandma prepped roasted red pepper with vinegar and garlic.

All these unfocused restaurants trying to please everybody...Tsk tsk.. ''A great recipe for failure'' said Bill Cosby if I am not wrong.  A seafood restaurant has to serve the freshest seafood that their coast line offers. Nothing else. That is what the rest of the world is doing rather than Starbucks or Safeway style customer service style focused menus. Oh, by the way, those are the great simple restaurants that you remember highly from your last vacation in the old world.

"42",1,"Normally when you call this place to make an order either to pick it up or thru phone, they ask you for the phone number.. so basically they have your profile. I always get the exact same thing lately they've been messing it up ALOT.. if a customer orders something and the restaurant sadly ran out of one of the ingredients for the food. they should let the customer know if they can replace it with something else maybe.(I worked at a restaurant for years) because the customer could decide if they want to continue with the Same order or maybe change it for something else. they made my order complete different and didn't even told me before I paid btw it tasted horrible. Now that I'm calling the place they're not even answering the phone. Thanks but never again.. there's better Chinese places on the same neighborhood. I'm done with this place(this is supposed to be a typical fried rice with veggies) but they just threw an egg in there",-1
"43",1,"Everything started out great and the restaurant has a great view from the balcony, however I ordered the fish tacos and one of the three was completely raw.  I mentioned it to the waitress and she said she would let the manager know.  She then brought over the bill without mentioning it at all.  When I told her the manager never came by she said she told him and because I ate two of the three tacos they decided that it wasn't an issue...Very strange and horrible customer service!",-1
"44",2,"My friends brought me here to surprise me for my birthday. The only surprise I got was the fishy, cheesy smell that seemed to permeate the whole restaurant. It was disgusting and I have to say, waiting in that restaurant made me lose any semblance of an appetite. 

The food wasn't too bad, big portions for the price. But I've certainly had better Italian at half the price. There was nothing spectacular; as a group, we started off with the Calamari and the Antipasto. The calamari was bland, but the antipasto wasn't too bad. I ordered the Lobster Ravioli, which was pretty good; my friends ordered the Rigatoni Alla Rachele (which was eggplant parmesan, chicken parmesan, sausage, and meatballs on top of rigatoni), the chicken parmesan pasta dish, and the chicken marsala. Overall, the Rigatoni Alla Rachele was the best bang for the buck. 

However, the mediocre food was not enough to make up for the atrocious service. We literally had to ask for the check five times...and it took another 30 minutes for them to actually bring us the check. The waiter was funny, but the service itself was just ridiculous. Granted, it was a busy night, but some of the staff was just standing around. 

There are better options in Allston; if I was really hungry in the area, I would forgo my love of Italian and go to either BonChon or Kaju Tofu House for Korean food.",-1

This fast food restaurant has NEVER gotten our order correct. The current workers cooking the chicken cannot understand the orders that come up on the screen because they don't speak English (first clue?). So we decided if we physically go inside to place our to go orders (instead of the drive-thru), we can at least get them to correct our order before getting all the way home. So far, they have a consistent track record...100% messing up our orders no matter what we do. Hint: you cannot tell if your chicken is spicy or mild by just ""eyeballing"" and inevitably we get home and have whatever they decide to throw in the boxes. Their motto s/b: ""Have it our way, or too bad!""",-1
"48",1,"Walked in and an employee was sitting down feeding her face saying sit wherever you like.  We chose a seat inside. We were served our drinks pretty quick but it went down hill from there . Bottom line is the service and the food left alot to be desired.  The servers never came to check on us until we said excuse me mam.  When we expressed our concern to one of the servers her response was they have other customers.  Thought this was the same as the one on Sand Lake but I know now it is definitely not.  Asked for the owner and he wasn't there so they gave me a card.  Guess what, website on card doesn't exist.  Will never go back!  Awful!!",-1

"50",2,"IF THIS IS AUTHENTIC VIETNAMESE FOOD, THEN WHY DONT I FEEL AT HOME?!?!
first off, they use broken rice... broken rice = half off in stores because the grains are broken... the texture tastes like mush and not full grains of rice. The service here leaves much to be desired... The food description are not really correct.. The pho taste bland and too much MSG. I make much better pho, but who got 14 hours to cook a pot of soup for 2? The attention to detail..... well not much... i travel into dorchester for vietnamese food... thank you very much",-1

The entire reason we went was so my bf could get the steak he liked before. I have never seen him send back food, but the steak he received was not just rare, but raw.  Sent it back and they brought out the same steak, still raw. Third time around they brought back the SAME steak. Of course it was done now, past the point of chewing.  Our meal was discounted in no way, which was the bummer at the end. That and the fact that all the waiters take your orders on a phone, so you have no eye contact, and you feel like your on a date with someone who is texting the whole time.  I want to like this place, but after yesterday I doubt i'll be back.",-1
"56",2,"The regular beef broth here is flavorful and texture of the noodles are very smooth, sometimes the beef here is tender and other times really tough

Their ""mild"" spice option is spicy as hell, I've had lots of spicy noodles from restaurants all around the area but damn this mild spice level murders them all

There's tons of options for noodles in the area but if you want super spicy you should try their hot level

Pros:
+ Noodle texture
+ Beef broth

Cons:
- Mild is freaking spicy
- Inconsistency
- Doesn't offer tea or water compared to alternatives",-1

I guess if you want five dollar plates of fried calamari and spaghetti and meatballs you're in luck, but I don't go out and get a $9 cocktail or glass of wine to eat from Chef boyardee. Service is very slow and neglectful. I have worked as a waitress so I am not a snob but I know how long it takes to do things if you want a good tip versus just resting on your 15%.

I got the roasted  chicken, which came out scaulding hot and covered in oil (suppose to be roasted not deep fried) and was sitting on shaved potatoes, that were overcooked and dry, covered in a mucoid lumpy cheese sauce and sided with disgusting undercooked risotto. All for the absurd price of $27.

My friend got a customized pizza which was good, very doughy but none the less good.

SErvice was horrible, we walked in and got snide faces from the hostess, waited for 20 minutes before our waiter finally showed up. got stale bread that came as our appetiers did.

What they DON'T KNOW how to do is provide service.

This place makes the US Congress look like a well-oiled machine. Too many times, my deliveries go to the wrong address, and when I call to cancel and get a refund, the phone line is tied up or I get put on hold.

The individual who completed my pedi and gel manicure were nice, as was the lady who seemed to be the owner/manager, however, the work wasn't very good. My nails were certainly far more problematic than the pedi. There was a lot of tugging at my cuticles when trimming which caused soreness and currently they look very jagged.  The polish was not done well - polish was pooled between the nail and my skin which resulted in the edges by my cuticles looking torn/ragged when trying to pull the polish off my skin. It's not been a full week and the polish is already lifting. To be fair, I didn't go back to the shop to complain or ask that they correct my nails. I just learned a lesson that this isn't the right nail shop for me and won't go back again.",-1

"69",1,"So this review is coming from a tourist who has never attended HHN previously, but was extremely excited to experience the Walking Dead and Silent Hill haunted houses as a bonus to our Disney vacation.

In short, our whole experience at HHN was disastrous. We waited in line (in the rain) for 1.5-2 hours for each haunted house, and each house takes about 3-4 minutes to walk through (not the greatest wait-time to ride-time ratio) . Everyone is herded into the houses in a continuous line, which really ruins the surprise element of the scares. We were always right behind the group that would be jumped at or surprised, so we weren't scared or surprised in the least.

Universal really needs to evaluate their capacity limit for HHN. Even on a stormy night, the lines were ridiculously long, and we only got to experience a fraction of the houses due to the wait times.

Unless you are a season pass holder with early access or fork over extra cash for the express pass, I wouldn't recommend attending. Don't waste a chunk of your night waiting in line for sub-par haunted houses.",-1

For a company event I was planning, against my better judgement, after initially being laughed at for asking for quote & having the woman on the phone be very curt to me when I inquired about them doing an event, I chose to use Jaciva's for a large cupcakes order. They refused to accommodate my simple request for a special color for the cupcake wrapper. Wanting to get these cupcakes taken care of and focus on the big picture of the event, I said OK, I will provide a special cupcake collar to achieve the look I want for my event. Low and behold, there ended up being a last minute issue with one of the Jaciva's employees not passing along a very important message about the delivery of the cupcake collars to the bakery. When I arrived to the bakery the morning of the event at 9am (opening time) with the cupcake collars the woman very rudely told me that the cupcakes had already been sent to our venue, and I would have to take care of putting the special collar on them myself. Myself. The day of. For 100+ cupcakes. I honestly felt like they couldn't care less about my satisfaction. It was absolutely unacceptable, and I was appalled. Bottom line, if you don't want to stress about a bakery order being taken care of properly and politely, don't use Jaciva's.",-1

Server advised us not to as she thought they tasted bad due to the wood oven. The cheese pizza was good, the mushroom pizza was poorly slapped together. We thought that a restaurant named ""Portobello "" would use portobello mushrooms on their menu items that state they have mushrooms on them. They instead used cheap button mushrooms. Shame on us for not listening to the waitress! Way overpriced for the quality and quantity. Service was poor due to server having too large of a section.

"75",1,"This is the icon of what is wrong with Massachusetts.  The Mass Turnpike Authority is the mentally retarded child of crooked politicans.  They gouge the taxpayers with high costs on tolls and pay massive salaries to people who could be replaced with a chimpanzee.  

What's ironic is, that the Mass Turnpike tolls actually cost more money to operate than they bring in.  This results in UBER DEBT!  So the solution of Deval Patrick and every other hack in the State House is........yup, that's right!  Raise tolls!  Funny, the south shore doesn't pay to enter Boston, hell New Hampshire residents don't either if they drive in on I-93.  If you take the Mass Pike or come from the North Shore......bend over.  There is no KY Jelly, there is no foreplay, the is no kiss afterwards.  You are straight up fucked.

So the Fast Lane transponder is now free, but using it requires extreme micromanagement because you may get hit with fees and charged for extra tolls that you didn't go through.  What's even better is that people in East Boston have to pay to enter the regular area of Boston (provided you don't try and cross through Chelsea/Everett into Watertown/Cambridge).  Does that make sense? They shouldn't have to pay a penny to enter!  Then again, nobody should!  Tolls are flawed system!

Massachusetts sucks, and this is one of the highlights of suckage.  Once you cross the Mason-Dixon line by Pennsylvania and Maryland......you notice there are no tolls on the roads you drive on.  Hmmmmm, I wonder why?  Maybe it has to do with the fact that people in the south wouldn't put up with this shit and that more conservatives are in office down there.  It's too bad residents of Massachusetts really won't stand up and say NO to the rich crooked politicans.

The cornbread you can pass on. It was dry and reminded me of that box cornbread mix from Martha White. The banana pudding they gave us free was gross; too sweet and taste mostly like bananas just mashed up. The fried fish whiting was cooked very well. The seasoning and batter used was good. Collard greens good. Potato salad was gross. Blackeyed peas were good.  Overall it was an experience and I would return for that fish.",-1

The carne asada taco is worth coming back for but I ordered the tamales on a whim because their board said they make them in house. The tamales were not too bad but I caught myself slogging on more hot sauce as my meal progressed. Until of course, I bit into the plastic. Lunch over.

I was informed that she was in a meeting and maybe another agent could help.  Fine.  I told her I did not have a lot of time but I would call back at lunch.

I have to eat gluten free and by the time I got home I had a huge rash all over my throat. I am not that sensitive so it had to have been a LOT of soy sauce or something in the food. I mentioned needing gluten free everything at least 4 times to the waiter.

We've been looking for a  good salad place and if the rest of their salads are as good as this one we'll be back for more. 

Gelato: FORGETTABLE, I've had better, but it is the only gelato place I know of in Altamonte Springs. 

Service: OK, not overly friendly and not rude. 

Atmosphere: OK, it has a sterile kind of feeling.  Lots of TVs and a huge brick oven pizza oven. 

Overall, I think I'll try their other salads and maybe the breadsticks (they have 4 different kinds). But I'll choose take out :) maybe stop by publix for a frozen California Kitchen pizza..... LOL",-1
"96",1,"So Sad, as this grocery store has been going downhill. Lately, most of the food is old and/or expiring soon (no longer fresh). For example, all the gallon jugs of milk for sale  are set to expire in a little over 7 days, the deli meat goes bad in a week, the stuff on sale expires within a month, the chicken wing bar has been  old/stale and gross, the eggs expire in a week,  and many vegetables/fruit are really ripe or bruised. This Safeway has also gotten really expensive. I will be shopping down the street at Freddy's or QFC from now on.",-1
"97",1,"What a disappointment. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. I reserved a room for my wedding night last weekend. We were excited to stay here and celebrate our wedding night but this was a disaster from the minute we got there. Valet lost the key to my car and argued with me for about 30-40 minutes saying the key wasn't in the car. Keep in mind these 30-40 minutes were right as we arrived. SO here we are standing in the lobby going back and fourth with the valet about the keys as we are still in our wedding clothes...wife still in her dress. The keys were finally found...in the car. The room wasn't what we expected either. We had a room on the 62nd floor which sounds great but once we got to the room we saw that we had a room right next to the outdoor elevator that takes guest to the Sundial restaurant. So half of our view was skyline, the other half was an elevator. We thought it would be fun to wear our wedding stuff up to have a bottle of Champaign in the sun dial so we went back to the lobby to catch the elevator up and were turned down. We were told there was a long wait list and they would put anyone else on the list. So here we are standing in our wedding clothes again in the lobby. How can a paying guest be denied access to the hotel restaurant and bar? We went back to the room and ordered Room Service. It took about 20 minutes and they forgot our dessert we ordered. We were told he would be right back with our dessert...he never came back. Finally when checking out the next morning I asked the desk if we could leave an overnight bag along with her wedding dress and my tux for my parents to pick up at the hotel so we didn't have to take them on our honeymoon. I was told not a problem. When I dropped the stuff off I was given a ticket and told to text it to my parents and tell them to be sure to have ID for pick up bc they wouldn't give our stuff to anyone without the ticket (or picture of the ticket) and ID. My parents picked the stuff up later that morning and guess what????No ID or ticket was required. They just rolled our belongings out for them to pick up. Luckily it was my parents. Overall a less than impressive stay and a waste of $300.",-1
"98",1,"Rude service and lots of excuses.  Had me wait 1 hour for a cab overnight (1-2am) and blamed the weather delays.  Reality is they gave poor directions on the phone and did not pick up phone in a timely way, after 45 minutes of waiting and a 3rd phone call, they gave new instructions on where to get picked up.  
Cabs are unfortunately the best way to get out, but if you do not plan to go far they won't take you. Uber has high airport fees - worse than cabs. If your trip is super far, cab to downtown then uber. Definitely do not pay these people to take you back to the airport, uber it back (no fees on your return).",-1
"99",1,"WORST SERVICE EVER!

I  had great difficulty getting the bikes to take  my account code and the password.  I had to try on 5 or 6 bikes till I was able to unlock one.  This happened each time I tried to unlock a bike.  The bikes are unwieldy, heavy and difficult to ride (and I ride bikes all the time).  The seats kept sliding down and the gears were difficult to change - which proved a real challange when going up and down hills around the bridges.  As much as I enjoy physical activity and exploring when I am in a new town, my recommendation is to either rent proper bikes for the duration of your visit, or utilize public transportation. Such a dissapointment - much better bike systems other cities such as Chicago, New Orleans, Boston & Detroit.",-1

This is the only location I've visited where the staff acts as if they're doing you a favor...get over yourselves your serving beer and chicken wings not diamonds and pearls.

I'm discovering that a lot of the restaurants on SoCo are really overrated AND overpriced.  I'm looking at you Guero's (most overrated restaurant in Austin, btw).

"108",2,"I wanted to love this place, we could use a great gourmet burger joint on Lamar. I purchased the BBQ burger and fries combo. The meat did not have much flavor and in fact had a slight cooking oil flavor to it. The burger was not impressive in size and did not match the quality of burgers at this price point offered by places like Hopdaddy, Phills Ice house, Dans and even Whata Burger. Quality defined as: good tasting beef, large patties, soft fresh buns, all flavors meld together to give you that ""ah"" moment. The fries were good if you like thick fresh cut fries. I don't and didn't care for them, though I'm not a fresh cut fry guy. I paid nearly $12 for my meal and will not return. It sucks I really want this place to take off and be a huge success.

The restaurant is large and I'm still eating, there WILL be more crumbs because that's how food works sometimes- sweep somewhere else and stop freaking me out.

The last two times have been just the worst attitude ever from the cashier. Look, I didn't kill your dog, or cat, or fish, or whatever. I have to go do a job I don't like with a smile so do yours, please.

I took my truck in to have the gasket on my oil pan replaced. Pretty routine, should only take an hour or so... they said that there was an issue with another oil leak (fine) and that it would take ""longer"". 

I couldn't get a straight answer on a time estimate from anyone and when I pressed it, they acted out out. Originally I was told an hour, then 3, then 5, it felt like they were just tacking on time to charge more for the repair time. 

I've never had any issues with my truck driving poorly until I left after my repair. Half way home my engine was lurching and shaking the entire truck when I accelerated and idled. Then my check engine light came on. Keep in mind, it drove perfectly on the way to get repaired and has never had issues like this before. I recently had a transmission service and should be good for another 50K miles at minimum. I was honestly concerned a belt was loose or a bolt/engine mount. 

When I brought it back in the manager was incredibly put out that I was back. 

I have no idea what they did, but they seriously messed up what should have been a simple repair. On top of all this, they left greasy hand prints ALL OVER my truck. The front bumper was covered in oily hand and shoe prints.

Truly truly awful fake Irish pub.  Went for dinner on a Friday night, and should have been tipped off by the fact that besides one other table, we were the only diners in the restaurant.  

We were seated next to the bathroom, and the wafting toilet aromas served as a precursor to the crap we were about to be served.  

Started with buffalo wings, which clearly came right out of a Costco bag.  They were not deep fried, but rather warmed in an oven, resulting in a chewy, disgusting mess.   Shepherds Pie bore virtually no resemblance to the classic British dish; instead it looked like baby vomit atop a pile of instant potatoes.  My dining companion only got about 3 bites down.   Burger likewise came from a bag of frozen patties, and the only cheese option was American.

While waiting for my first drink, the person in front of me turned around after receiving his and said, ""Get out of my way"" even though there was space on either side of me.  Then there was the group of Jaeger Bombers...  Some idiot was dancing in the bar area and kept bumping in to me, oblivious of his surroundings...  I whipped out my phone and texted 3 words to my friends en route - ""High douchebag quotient"" which pretty much sums up the place.

My friends started trickling in.  While walking up the front porch, one of them was knocked in the head by some dumb whore who took a little too long to apologize.  We got our drinks (hooray for nice, efficient bartenders!) and went outside so we didn't have to converse by yelling.

No place to sit and the after watching a girl remove her shoes to hula hoop poorly then bend over to pick it up and revealing her snatch (uh, you trashy bitch), I grabbed a hoop and decided to make my own fun.  That's right, I can spin a hula hoop around my knees.  And cheers for the ice water coolers and cups out back!  For those of us who like liquor and not beer, you should have bigger glasses.  A $7 cocktail shouldn't come in an undersized glass.

One of my friends said that it was much better during the week... the music wasn't as loud, the crowd was thinner and more diverse, and there were actually places to sit.  Upon leaving, another friend stated, ""Well, I won't be going back there again...""

The food is good. I've gotten the chicken parm panini and it's very good, however, it's very very light on the sauce. I am not a huge fan of red sauce, and even I found myself buying extra because without it, the sandwich is a little dry. But still, very good. The *best* part are the homemade potato chips with rosemary that come with.  I made a point to even ask if I could buy a bag separately in the future, and was told I could. 

One night I bought sandwiches to go for the fam, and was severely disappointed (and embarrassed) that the take out girl did not put chips in the bag with the sandwiches, even though she did tell me that they come with all sandwiches. I know this is a  little thing, but I'm obsessed with them and was really looking forward to enjoying them. Not cool, TK. 

All in all, food is good, potato chips (if you're lucky enough to get them) are phenomenal, but it's very expensive for a sandwich and there are better options out there for a lunch/dinner.

An hour passes and we check our reservation, and we're told it's going to be another hour. So back to the bar, and we order more drinks and apps as it looks like we're in for the long haul. Another hour passes and half my party leave, over the wait and over Bartaco. Me and my date decide to stay at the bar and order there. The food arrives, and it's okay.

The chicken parm was decent, the polenta and braised beef was a big shlop i could barely eat. The place was dead, but we were placed in the back corner because the nearby tables hadn't been cleared. And stayed that way for the majority of our dinner. Our bread was cold, crumbly, and just blah. Not the usual warm, fresh rolls you'd usually get.

"150",2,"Dillons O Dillons. What happened to your menu? We had dinner at Dillon's three months ago, and they had an awesome burger menu with lots of options. We decided to eat there the other night BECAUSE we had such a good experience. Not so much this time around. We sat out on the patio because it was a nice evening. We were given laminated menus which had many fewer options than the previous menu. We thought that maybe they had a special patio menu... not the case. I ordered the veggie burger, and I asked what came on it, and the waitress said NOTHING. Really? Your default burger is just a patty and bun? Okay. Give me lettuce, tomato and onion please. The veggie burger was pretty obviously a reheated frozen mess, dry and tasteless. The veggie burger last time was way more awesome. 

It was a busy night on the patio, and the service was quite slow. We ended up getting pretty cold towards the end of the meal when the sun went down, and we were all huddling together while we waited forever for the check. 

With all of the other options in the Back Bay, I think I'll go somewhere else next time.",-1
"151",2,"Hi. Yes, I know, don't look at me that way. Sure I don't understand part of my contract or why I can't get the iPhone upgrade two months early, but that doesn't mean you can't smile or at least look bemused at my clear lack of mobile phone knowledge. I'm still not sure how you magically leapt from explaining why I can't upgrade early to trying to convince me to upgrade my minutes plan instead (because of course there's no way I am going to survive on the 2240 rollover minutes I have left for the year!). 

Funny - it's usually the other way around. Over the phone customer service is awful and in-store customer service is better. Both AT&T boy and AT&T girl were kind of helpful, but if you want someone who will actually interact with you in a normal manner then 1-800 it up!",-1
"152",2,"Pasta Vino is a relatively expensive restaurant. So, it's reasonable to expect a higher standard here than at, say, a fast food place.

Positives:
1. Despite the fact that the individual with our party responsible for making reservations had not done so, they squeezed in our party of six fairly quickly.

Negatives:
1. If you, a relative, or a friend, must use a wheelchair, skip Pasta Vino. This is one of those restaurants with a twee demi-wall near the door - the sort that is nearly, if not actually, impossible to get a wheelchair around. The tables are packed in so tight that I could barely walk between them to reach the restroom. The dining area and the hall with the restrooms is separated by a decorative bead curtain that is, apparently, metal. I can't imagine how anyone in a wheelchair could possibly use the restroom.

2. Most meals are a stand alone entree with no vegetable or salad on the side. Complimentary bread is served, but who wants to fill up on carb-packed bread while waiting for a meal of carb-packed pasta? No one, that's who. Meanwhile, fricking CiCi's has a salad bar at no extra charge with their ""pizza"" buffet. For heaven's sake Pasta Vino, man cannot live by bread alone: throw some lettuce, broccoli, and grape tomatoes in a bowl and include salad with meals as a standard side dish.

3.Only alcoholic drinks are refilled. Two of our party ordered water, two soda, and two alcohol. Despite requests, only people drinking alcohol received refills/additional beverages during our meal. Both water drinkers and one soda drinker ran completely out of beverage before our meals arrived. The last time the waiter came to the table, we AGAIN asked the waiter to refill our water/soda. He nodded in the affirmative and asked ""is everything okay?"" One of the alcohol drinkers boomed ""everything is fantastic!"" Maybe the waiter thought that meant we didn't need beverages with our meal after all? We were so thirsty we could not even fairly judge the food. Was it tasty? I was too thirsty to tell.",-1

My husband and I decided to give this place a try for the first time, tonight, and ordered it to go. We got the supreme with no mushrooms. Anyway- my husband got home with the pizza and I pulled out the first slice. I tried to bite it, but couldn't because it was so floppy and soggy that I had to strain my neck in order to get it into my mouth. It was literally bent at a ninety degree angle in my hand. I would even venture to say that the dough was raw, except for the edge crust and the toppings were sliding off. I actually had to put it back into my oven to make it edible. I took photos as well because I am shocked at how terrible this pizza was. It was equivalent to eating a beef flavored, lukewarm wet towel. I gave it a two instead of a one because the topping were cooked and my salad was good.

When the date of appointment came, I left a note describing where the valve could be found.  I later received a phone message from the tech saying that no one was home.  Fortunately he gleaned from the note what he was supposed to do, but apparently had no instructions from his boss.  I later called him and asked if he checked the sprinkler sweep and he said that was not on his work notes.

"166",2,"One visit was enough for me.  We stopped here on our way to pick someone up at the airport.  I got a portobello mushroom sandwich, sweet potato tater tots, and a watermelon beer. My boyfriend got a half lb burger with bacon and cheese. According to the menu, and the waitress, it came with lettuce, tomato, onion, and sauce. He ordered macaroni salad, but received onion rings. After pointing it out, and asking for the ketchup, mustard, and veggies, we got the ketchup and macaroni salad.  He had to get up and get the mustard from the waitress station, and the lettuce, tomato, and onion never made it over to us. 

My sandwich was fine, but the tater tots were so plain and soggy. The burger that my boyfriend received looked like a slider, NOT a half lb. burger. The macaroni salad was extremely bland.  Did I mention that you don't get a side with your sandwich?

We waited about 15 minutes for the waitress to come take our food order, and then my date's meal arrived with my salad course, 20 minutes before my entree. His lamb kabob was delicious, but he had completely finished eating by the time my schawarma plate arrived. 

Our waitress didn't even notice the mistakes because she never came to check on us. Furthermore, we were never served any pita bread, which was supposed to come with both our meals. (This wouldn't have been such a big deal except most of my schawarma plate was intended to be eaten with pita, not by itself, so I wasn't even able to eat most of my food.) The only good thing about the meal was that it was free-- after we had been waiting over an hour, our waitress finally came and apologized for the horrible service and comped our meals.

I attempted to go to Paddy Wagon but, after waiting in line for 15 min, I was told the chicken would take another 15 minutes to cook. A bit of an inconvenience, since I don't want to be the extern that takes over an hour lunch break! So I opted for Pitabilities. The line was not too long, but there was a crowd of people waiting for their food. This cart was certainly attracting attention, so I was excited to see what all the fuss was about. I ordered a chicken pita with all the fixin's, shoe string fries, and a soda. All in all, about $12, which I found to be a bit pricey for what it was...the drink alone was $3! I normally would have passed and gotten one for 65 cents at the office, but it was 90 degrees, and I'm glad I did, because I waited 20 minutes for my food.  The food itself was tasty, but not memorable. The chicken was very moist, but the pita was very soggy and fell apart.  I die for a good food truck, but this was not much different than what I typically find at the gyro stands I stumble upon at 2am after a night on Park Street!

Here's where I have a problem, I like a medium burger but that's when you have a bit of a chair or grill on the outside, the burger seemed as if it was just flat out under cooked (mushy). The bun was soggy from the grease and the lettuce was warm and limp. I spent $50 for me and my two girls, I would not recommend this place. I can get a much better burger for less at Boardwalk Burgers on Lamar next to the broken spoke for about $28, I know this because we eat there on a reg basis.

"186",1,"I've been here many times over the years, and it's always been wonderful, but this time I found multiple 2 inch strips and spirals of sharp metal in my lobster and crab bisque (not foil, but thicker strips of tin or aluminum).  I accidentally swallowed one before I could stop it from going down--it was soup, so I just wasn't expecting to swallow a cocktail sword--at that moment I didn't worry too much about it, although it definitely was sharp as it scratched the side of my throat--but I thought since this was Eddie V's that my bisque must have just been made fresh and I happened to get a rare piece of claw cartilage .

Then I had another bite and felt what seemed like a bone, which shellfish don't have, so I pulled it out.  It was 2 inch long sharp metal spiral, painted on one side and shiny on the other.  I realized it was also the same size of the piece I had just swallowed.  These spirals can come off when you open one of those 10"" diameter soup cans with a restaurant-size electric can opener--it also means there could be a lot more of those in their soup pot back in the kitchen.

The bartender apologized and took it back to the kitchen immediately, but I expected something like that to prompt a manager to come out, and hopefully pick up any other patrons' crab bisque as well as a precaution.  Something like that not being handled properly can and should end a restaurant.  It may have been embarrassing, but metal shards in food is potentially life threatening since it has to travel through 7 meters of small intestines making hundreds of turns along the way there's a lot of opportunity to slice or puncture and cause internal bleeding.  It's at least going to make some cuts on the way out.  While death from punctures is statistically rare, dishing out a hundred bowls of soup will up your chances of killing someone's grandma at her birthday dinner and making your new remodel a great location for someone else's restaurant.

The soup was taken off the bill, but instead of just generously comping the $9 bowl of metal bisque, they probably should have comped the $43 dollar glass of Macallan 18 sitting next to it (that's half the wholesale price of the bottle btw).  Or maybe even my whole meal since all I was going to leave with was anxiety over what the hell I just ate.

I had already broken into a sweat as I pondered the only way this little sword was going exit, so I wasn't concerned with being comped at the time, and since I figured there was more metal in the big pot in the kitchen I declined the offer of another bowl.  I was actually more worried about all the old people eating in there--I pictured some sweet old lady (sorry but it's an older crowd) screaming in the bathroom the next day.  Turns out I was the only one worried.  A manager never came out.  

If a server comes back to the kitchen holding up a 2 inch twist of metal found by a patron that should be treated like they found a 2 inch cockroach doing the backstroke in their soup.  It's a big deal.  If it's not, then you must be used to seeing some pretty messed up stuff in your kitchen.  I should have heard a solid Gordon Ramsey impression in the kitchen from where I was sitting but nothing happened.

I had already decided I wasn't coming back ever again though, since I clearly valued this restaurant a lot more than they valued me, so instead of ordering my usual bone-in filet and another scotch I went with fish and a Stella.

In the end, the best thing about my dinner was the one thing I already had in my own refrigerator at home, Stella.

If anyone else thinks they ate metal in their bisque be sure to drink plenty of water, avoid meat, bananas, peanut butter and nuts; have a salad, actually have several; have 3 tablespoons of mineral oil mixed with yogurt before bed; get yourself some stool softeners; and when it's time to go, strap in tight and bite down on something.  Otherwise you might just cut your o-ring in half when that bad boy exits.  Good luck friends and remember, what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.",-1

Two different types of Ramen - Ramen was actually good, flavor wise.  Especially the marinated egg.  Problem is that the broth was very warm but not super hot, so the cold ingredients that they topped the soup with brought the temp down low and the pork belly served with mine ended up staying on the cold side.

Today was not the case of that at all! They sat us in the back booth right next to an employee entrance which would have been fine but after you read this review, you will see it was far from. 
We had a waitress named Elizabeth and she seemed very promising at first. She asked us what we wanted to drink and any appetizers we wanted. She brought us a big thing of chips and 2 salsas. Little did we know... that was all we would see of her for a whole hour after immediately putting our food in. I get being in the service industry it can be difficult. That sometimes you may have more tables than you can handle. (Sadly, there are no excuses for what we just endured because there were maybe 3 tables being used at that time.)  When I finally received my orange juice an hour later and then our food FINALLY came out you could tell my plate had been sitting under a heat lamp for a good while. The cheese and beans made that crust film over it. You know, when you can poke holes in it and see that the top layer has dried and hardened. We waited so long for our food that we were full from the chips and salsa we had. We immediately asked for to go boxes as we had been sitting there hearing the employees in the back repeatedly bang on something, non-stop the whole time we were there. She finally came to get our card to pay which was an act of congress in itself, and we waited a good 10 minutes and she was still just walking around and still hadn't even processed our card. After the continuous banging on whatever they were hitting, we couldn't take it anymore and we went to the middle and asked if she could just run our card. She said yes here you go just leave it here when you finish and walked away. We went to the front and I mentioned to the hostess ""hey, just a heads up, where you sat us was extremely noisy so you probably don't want to sit other people there"" she brushed it off saying ""my bad"" with no real concern at all. So I'm sure that the next customers coming in will be sat right there with no real thought again and I pitty them and hope they bring ear plugs, and don't forget to order EVERYTHING YOU WANT right then and there in the beginning.

"195",1,"Disgusting and inedible.  I was really craving Chinese food, and had not ordered any since moving to the area last September.  I ordered spring rolls, crab rangoon, and bean curd with broccoli for delivery.  Everything was awful, except for the white rice which ended up being my dinner.  What irritated me the most was that I ordered more food than I wanted, assuming I'd eat the leftovers the next day; live and learn.  Nineteen dollars down the drain for food that smelled like wet dog.  Fortunately I satisfied my craving the next night with food from Chilli Garden in Medford, where the food was much better (but not great.)

The one positive thing I can say about China Delight is that the delivery was prompt.",-1
"196",1,"It occurred to me that this restaurant may be a hot favorite more for the ambiance - including a heavy dose of globalism and feeling of overall worldly goodness - rather than the quality of it's food. 

My friends and I ordered the spring rolls which were mediocre at best (hint: PF Chang would be a much better option). The Tiger Tear was inedible - picture cold, partly raw beef strips in a tasteless salad with an over powering crunchy white powder that made it difficult to chew. To quote my brother, ""tiger tears bring you to tears.""

The one saving dish was ""chicken and rafiny stirfry"". But even this was average compared to the cuisine in nearby China Town.

Overall, if you don't solely focus on coolness,  and would much rather judge a place for the food it serves, give Myers and Chang a pass.

"198",1,"An open letter to Kreuger Farms:

Dear Mr. Kreuger,

I have been a loyal customer for over 15 years.  I have had many memorable times coming to your farm to pick fruits, pumpkins and feast on the goodies sold in your market. I expected the same experience today, but sadly, was greatly mistaken. 

I came to pick raspberries, but because it was raining, was in the market area waiting for the rain to subside. While I was contemplating buying a flat, one of your employees brought over a sign that raised the price of the flats and stuck it on the cart. When I remarked about the price, she flippantly said that I was too slow and should have gotten it sooner.

I saw you come over and was about to make a comment, when you interrupted me and said, ""that's what supply and demand is."" And walked away.

I would like to believe that you and your staff were just having a bad day and that customers usually are usually treated with better customer service instead of being subjected to the blatant price hikes and rude comments I experienced today.

Your ""lesson"" in supply and demand was taken to heart. And I'm sorry to say that I will never be coming back to support your market again. Also, I will encourage my friends and colleagues who are looking for farm fresh produce and fruits to consider alternative more customer friendly establishments. 

I know my change in patronage will not impact your bottom line at all, but I would encourage you to think about what true customer service means and practice that with your other patrons, before the demand for your goods drops due to how you treat your customers.

Sincerely,
Former Kreuger farms fan",-1
"199",2,"Came here on a lunch date with the boyfriend.

Mad mozza bread - This bread is literally half cheese, half bread. They were not kidding around when they decided to load this appetizer up with cheese. Seriously half cheese half bread. Which is great if you love cheese (who doesn't?).

Regular cheesesteak - Pretty good but the hoagie was kind of soggy. The meat was good but I felt like having a firmer bun would do wonders for the construction of the sandwich, which kinda fell apart after a while.

Service - Was fine. Feels like a diner inside but we didn't have a problem getting a table.

Sidenote - The dough on the boyfriend's calzone wasn't cooked fully on top. When we first brought this to the attention of the waitress, she dismissed it as being cheese...last time I checked, cheese wasn't exactly an integral ingredient in dough. However, she ended up taking it off our bill so it wasn't too big of a deal.

Verdict - Most likely pass. I didn't believe other Yelpers when they said you'd end up smelling like a greasy spoon after you left. But as I was sitting in my car, driving along back to work, that distinctive grease smell oozed from my hair. I think this could be avoided if their kitchen didn't open directly into the dining area, but eh, what can you do?",-1

We 3 got seats at the counter where I was able to observe what was going on in the cooking area behind it. I ordered the chips with 2 pieces of fish for $12. I thought the price was a little steep at this quality. The chips were cut thick and good (I haven't had a fry I didn't like) but the coleslaw came from a bag in the fridge. The pieces of fish were substantial but it was pretty flavorless and I wondered if they came from a bag in the freezer... the tarter sauce was supposedly homemade and good but you only get a little bit in a teeny plastic cup. You can get a pint of beer brewed right on Granville Island for $5 which was nice but I recommend seeking out another place for decent fish and chips.",-1

Perhaps I have become stingy over the years, but a small bowl of green chicken curry is already $14 and an unimpressive platter consisting of about 8 pcs of appetizers is $16. Taste is mediocre and so is the service. I would think twice before returning.",-1
"202",2,"I don't really write reviews but I just couldn't let it go how uncomfortable they made me feel, with that being said for being a first time customer they really made me feel like I was inconveniencing them by not knowing their menu, and having a child with me.

It was moderately busy after being seated I felt they just wanted me and my family in and out didn't bring me napkins, or a soup spoon For my ramen! Didn't refill my water , After being seated no one came back to check on me until the check was ready I don't expect to be treated like royalty but basic customer service goes a long way with me or anyone they lost a customer.

"203",2,"I used to love 50 plates and have eaten here often. Four of us had dinner recently and all agreed it wouldn't be worth going back to.  Nothing exceptionaly horrible, but nothing great either.  Bar has limited brands, so you probably won't get your favorite top shelf.  The food used to taste like REALLY good comfort food with a gourmet twist.  They've lost it somehow, and there were several items that used to be favorites aren't on the menu.  They don't do a very good job of describing some of their items either.  ""Mac & Cheese w/chicken"" actually  had chicken pate type meat stuffed into a rigatoni noodle. It wasn't awful - just not great either.  Maybe if they offered more than 8 noodles we might have gotten into it.  One of the side dishes came right out of the freezer and ""oops, they forgot to microwave it before putting it on our plate"".  The dessert came and was entirely not what we ordered either. Oops, again.  The service was just ok took. Maybe they were having a bad night but I can't see why I'd go back when there are so many places in town that do a fantastic job!",-1

The one manager was running around doing everything and was super apologetic and very kind, so please excuse her from this review. Our waiter/bartender didn't speak - literally. He did not speak to us, come to our table ever again once our order was taken. It was instead the manager running food, getting sides, getting our check, ringing us up, etc. It was hard to pay for this experience.",-1
"205",2,"If you are getting your hair done for an important event, I'd recommend NOT taking your chances with this place. It's a hot mess, management-wise. The actual blow out was fine and my stylist was good, but the scheduling and service leave much to be desired.

I came here to get a blow out for a friend's wedding. Walked in 10 mins before my appointment and the whole place was just jam-packed. I checked in and the receptionist offered me tea and told me I'd be waiting for ""a while"". When I asked how long I'd have to wait, she pointed to the party of six by the window and said ""oh we have to take care of them before we get to you."" I pressed for a time estimate and was not given one. 15 mins? 30? I told her I had to know because I had a wedding to go to. She then told me that those girls waiting were a wedding party, they had places to go too and that she could not tell me how long I'd have to wait. No apologies, nothing. 

Another lady came in with a 2pm appointment and was basically told to ""wait a while"" too. A few minutes later, the two of us were told that the wedding party of six and either one of us could get our hair done soon, while the other would have to ""wait a while"". Ummmm are we supposed to duke it out or something for going first? Again, no time estimate. No apologies.

In the end, I waited about 20 minutes. Not the end of the world, but the absolutely unprofessional, and frankly rude, manner with which I was greeted and talked to was not acceptable. I wanted a time estimate when YOU were running late, and YOU acted like I was inconveniencing you. 

On top of that, my friend made an appointment for a blowout and the system messed up and made it for three days earlier. (Somehow no one called her to tell her she missed an appointment three days prior. The receptionist even checked her in before telling her 10 mins later that the appointment times were messed up. ) Thankfully the bride's hair and makeup could slide my friend in for a session before the wedding, so crisis averted. 

Drybar has major management issues. Avoid if you want to be certain you'll get a blow out the way you want it, WHEN you want it.

When I got there, the sales manager had no idea why I was told to come in. He only had a ""post-it note"" on his desk telling him to call me in... he got another guy to come over to tell me that there was a mistake in the financing and that I had to trade the car in. I asked what happend to the guy who sold me the car and they said that the sales rep who sold me the car no longer worked there. So they fired the guy who made the mistake and had no decency to help me around the mistake so I can keep the car.

"212",1,"VERY DISAPPOINTED AND INSULTED.

I've been to Animal Trustees quite a few times in the past and was happy with the service I received, but just recently my husband and I had a terrible time which negated everything that happened previously.

Back in November of last year, my husband and I found a chow mix wandering around the Oakwood Cemetery in East Austin. I'm a sucker who just can't say no to a stray, so we decided to rescue him. There was no way for us to keep him forever because (a) he was too big for a household that already has five pets (b) he doesn't get along with my cats at all and (3) I'm allergic to him. We decided that we would just pay for his medical treatment (he's heartworm positive) and then find him a good home.

My husband and I don't have much money, so Animal Trustees was our first port of call because we know that they do cheap heartworm treatment.  When we went to get a heartworm test, we immediately encountered a very snotty receptionist who was talking down to other clients in the waiting room. Admittedly, these people probably hadn't been taking as good care of their pets as they should have done but, hey, they'd taken the time to come to Animal Trustees, and that's a helluva lot more than many people do. If you want people to provide consistent veterinary care for their pets, then lecturing them in a condescending, disrespectful manner in the waiting room is NOT the way to go about it.

When it was our stray's turn to get attention, we were soon on the receiving end of this woman's acid tongue. The dog was scared when the vets tried to give him a heartworm test, and they had a lot of trouble trying to muzzle him. Apparently, he snarled at them and was aggressive. Of course, this is not a good thing, but please remember that this dog was not really ours and we had had no time to train him. We had just recently rescued him, and were trying to get him better, so we could pass him onto a owner who could better deal with his behavioural issues. 

Despite the fact that we had rescued this dog and were trying to help treat him, we got a lecture from the receptionist about how we were terrible and irresponsible dog owners.  We explained that the dog was generally very sweet-natured and calm, and that he would behave a lot better if only one of us could go behind the scenes and help the vets muzzle him. For some reason, this was not allowed, and so the dog contined to be problematic because there was no-one there to comfort him (although he eventually did get a heartworm test).

A month or so later, my husband encountered the exact same situation when he took the dog back to get the first round of heartworm treatment. He was not allowed to be anywhere near the dog while the vets tried to muzzle him. In the end, the vets decided that the dog was ""too aggressive"" to get treated, and my husband was sent away, told never to return because he got angry and tried to argue with them about their decision. If this wasn't bad enough, the vets had somehow managed to pump the dog full of sedatives in preparation for the heartworm treatment. These sedatives really affected the dog quite badly, and made him sickly and depressed for a couple of days afterwards! It's shocking that he should have been filled with drugs only not to receive the treatment. 

I understand that vets and vet techs should not have to be endangered by an animal but the fact is that this dog is simply not an aggressive dog. He can be aggressive, sure, when he's scared, but he would have calmed down had my husband been allowed to comfort him. 

Finally, I was insulted to be treated in such a rude and disrespectful manner by Animal Trustees staff. Yes, the dog was problematic but many stray animals have behavioural issues, and should they just be euthanized or be left to wander the streets because they've been abused in the past? We really tried to help this dog and it really wasn't our fault that he had never been given any proper training before we found him.

I don't think that Animal Trustees should be so rude to people who rescue animals on a regular basis. They should also be more considerate of the financial backgrounds of the people who are their customers. We don't own a car, and took three taxis to their clinics (at a total cost of about $60!) to try to solve this dog's heartworm issues. This was money we could ill afford.

Now we are $60 down, and the dog still has heartworm! We can't afford to go to a normal vet for the treatment quite yet, so the poor dog will just continue to get sicker and sicker. 

Thanks, Animal Trustrees!",-1

I don't write reviews often, but after what happened earlier today I couldn't hold myself back from doing so. I came in to purchase stuffed pepper and pilaf, and I kindly asked if they could put a scoop of sour cream. She looked at me like I'm crazy. She told me to go buy some sour cream and that she wasn't just going to put some in my to go box unless I will be eating there. Well first of all I am not asking for free sour cream and second of all I do not need a 10 oz. container of sour cream either. Previously when I purchased food and asked for sour cream they provided it because it's common sense to provide condiments when you are selling ready to eat food.

You might even compare them to one another to be sure they are the same length. 

Needless to say that after waiting two weeks my curtains aren't even the same length. There is a good 1.25"" difference in length where they come together side by side.

They use this kind of tuna mash instead of whole pieces of fish.  I'm pretty sure the only reason is to stretch the product.  Its mushy and gross.

"222",1,"I have taken my car to Beaverton Toyota for 9 years.  About 5 years ago we had a disappointing experience when they told me they fixed my car but it continued to make the same noise (and when I took it back they had to completely replace the transmission, which was still under warranty).  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and continued to take it there because it is about 10 minutes from my house.  After my most recent visits I have decided to never take my car there again.  They scheduled me for a same day appointment and when I got there was told that it was actually scheduled for the day before.  I was charged for a ""loaner car"" when I had work done even though it has always been complimentary in the past.  I took my car in for a service (scheduled almost 2 weeks before) and when I got there was told the technician was not there and they were not sure I could be seen that day (but did I want a shuttle to take me home?).  I was overcharged by $52 for an oil change- good thing I caught it before they swiped my car.

"225",1,"We had leased a highlander in 2010 and recently decided to purchase the vehicle back in November 2012 since we love the car. Ever since the day we signed the papers it's been an ongoing nightmare until a week ago. On a side note: Tony Hassini (salesman) is wonderful!!! He leased the car to us and every time we came in for maintanence he always greeted us and made us feel so welcome. He always offered his assistance. Definitely recommend seeing him for any future purchases! 

Now back to the reason of my review, it has to do with the finance department. I won't give all the details but the mistake that happened wasn't just one mistake, it was an ongoing snow ball effect of terrible customer service. It was so frustrating and embarassing. We were dealing with Two individuals (David Delay & Micky). To make a long story short these two individual were handling an issue that was ""toyota financials"" fault (lender) which they repeatedly pointed fingers too. It wasn't my fault and ""supposedly"" not David's either. David was the original Finance rep we were dealing with but due to other reasons we ended up dealing with Micky. My main complaints are:

1) They never followed through on the ""Toyota Promise"" with us personally. We never felt that our issue was a priority to them. It took from 11/03/2012 - 01/2013 for all this to be resolved. 
2) Don't bother making an appt with Mickey because he won't be available at the time of the appt. He'll make you wait an hour past your appt.
3) They both lacked communication with us & with eachother. We ended up playing phonetag which is a headache and complete nightmare. 
4) I found myself repeatedly explaining myself over and over and over again each time we spoke. Seemed like they always forgot our situation.
5) They gave us the run around, apologized for their NUMBEROUS mistakes and offered us a free carwash. WOW!!! 
6)They never resolved the issue - We left the cubicle with nothing resolved and Tony Hassini saw how upset we were and had us speak with a General Manager, who ended up resolving the issue in two days!

It was super upsetting, embarrassing and disapointing. I expected Micky or David to really step up and resolve our issue, assuming that they would take good care of us. But unfortunately that wasn't the case. I'm sure they are good at their jobs but maybe my situation wasn't a priority. I am thankful to Beaverton toyota for whatever they paid for on the back end but coming from a consumers stand point and grading on customer service, Micky and David have no idea what customer service means. I suggest you both be retrained on how to treat your customers, respect their time and business, mean what you say and follow through on your word. The last thing a customer wants is to be fed a bunch of bull when you're the reason why there is a problem. Hopefully your other customers are treated better than we were.",-1
"226",2,"The good:

There are two things Nantasket Beach has going for itself: 

1. The long beach. If you are in the mood for a long walk along the beach, this is your place. Long long beach gives you plenty of space to go for a romantic walk or clear your mind alone. 

2. Compared to other beaches I've been to in MA this summer, this so far is the easiest and cheapest one to park at. We paid $10 and were a step away from the beach. Very cool. 

The Bad:

1. High tide: We got there at 10:00 am and set up shop as high as possible on the sand to avoid potential waves eating our stuff later in the day. It didn't matter. By 12:30 we were inches away from the water hitting us. This is a known element to Nantasket vets. High tide and the relatively little left over sand causes people to pretty much retreat to the nearby rocks or move down the beach to snatch up the little left over space. When I go to a beach I want to set up an umbrella, seats, towel, and not have to worry about it again. This issue alone makes Nantasket impossible for me to enjoy as a beach I can relax on. 

2. The people: I am not a snob (but rather a normal, in shape, nice looking guy). I don't need to be surrounded by buff and perfect bodies to enjoy a beach, but the company you'll find yourself around in Nantasket is disgusting. Way more than any other beach I've been on this summer in MA. It's like a bad tattoo convention. Just really gross people. This especially hit me when we took a long walk on the boardwalk. 

3. Food: Any beach that has a restaurant within walking distance of our umbrella is always a nice plus. Sadly the dining options at Nantasket are less than desirable. We had a quick lunch at Raffael's and were disappointed. The reviews for The Red Parrot here on Yelp are very mixed. Safe to say, bring your own food. One nice touch is that you can go to Dunkin Donuts if desired as you walk along the boardwalk. 

I'm going to give this beach two stars simply because you can take a nice long walk on the beach or boardwalk. But I would NEVER return with the prospect of setting up shop along the beach.

PS. Forgot to mention this: no soft sand. Yup, you are forced to walk or lie on hard sand everywhere on the beach. A shame really as a great beach will always feature soft sand in some area. Not here.",-1
"227",1,"Today June 1st, 2016 I visited the Bldg. Dept of the City of Quincy and spoke to the ELECTRICAL INSPECTOR about the SunFactoryUSA tanning at 470 So. Artery Quincy.  

CONTRARY to the notices Peter Cappadona and Rachel Losordo taped to the window, the Electrical inspector states they are LYING when they indicate the AC was being upgraded and the re-opening is subject to a final inspection.

The TRUTH is National Grid the electrical supplier has SHUT OFF their electricity when it was discovered the electrical meter HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH. 

By tampering with the meter it then records 1/2 or even 1/3 of the actual electricity being used. National Grid will NOT turn the electricity back on until the STOLEN electricity is paid and a new meter is installed.  Typically National Grid will also pursue legal action.

The electrical inspector states the closing has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the AC as the notices in the window have stated.

Peter Cappadonna and Rachel Losordo (her maiden name as they are possibly married)  PLACED TWO LADDERS in the foyer as a RUSE ...along with their first notice that the AC was being upgraded.  

Naturally to the casual observer these ladders indicated maintenance was on-going.  HOW CLEVER and DECEITFUL.

Subsequently notices transcended into statements that they were opening pending an electrical inspection of the ""new AC"".   This notice was changed several times....until no notice was left.

The ONLY reason they are closed is because they were CAUGHT STEALING ELECTRICITY!   

The DECEITFUL notices to their customers was just a ruse so they could probably continue billing  their customers, either to finance the money they owe National Grid or to simply abscond with as much of their customer's money as possible.

My advice is to immediately call your credit card company explaining the THEFT CHARGES TO YOUR ACCOUNT 

I went to their home at 9 Grogan Ave, Quincy, Ma  02169 a couple of weeks ago and left a polite note inquiring as to when they might re-open.  I received an e-mail from Rachel; Info@SunfactoryUSA.com    that they were opening in a few days after the City of Quincy had approved the ""new AC unit.  A BOLD FACED LIE!

A week later when I stopped by the salon one evening I was met by Rachel who again repeated to my face her BOLD FACED LIES about the new AC and the subsequent re-opening.  

Obviously you know their business line is disconnected, their website www.SunfactoryUSA.COM is down (the URL is for sale) and their HOME Tel#  617-472-6475 is no longer in service.  They probably temporarily disconnected it to avoid any customers calling them.

"228",1,"Horrible service, I had to repeat my order multiple times and the people I was with didn't get their order. The server left ""early"" so our table was left to no one. Taking my food to go next time.",-1
"229",1,"Absolutely horrible. Fleeced us of $430 for 35 minutes of work (after quoting $65) to get a car unstuck from a tree trunk. It all started when I called the State Farm roadside assistance line to help a woman that came to our house to interview for a childcare position, it took them over 3 hours to arrive (that should have been a sign) then they spent like 20 minutes to get the front end of the car out of the tree trunk and then went to move their truck to another position, when they got their tow truck stuck in the mud. It took them 2 hours and a second truck (and us helping - bringing sand, wood planks, and cardboard from our house). The whole ordeal lasted 5.5 hours, ending at midnight, at which point we were exhausted. They handed us a bill for $365 after charging me $65 by phone, for a total of $430. To top it off, they left behind the broken wood planks, boxes, and torn up grass for us to fix... absolutely insane that we had to pay for not only the car we called to get out (which wasn't even our own) but also for the tow truck to get out - that's their job, they should know their trucks' limits and how to get it out.",-1
"230",1,"Bait and Switch. Beware.
Spoke to a Curry Honda salesman (Ricke Johnson) on the phone and agreed upon a sales price (tax, title, doc fees)  for a new vehicle. Showed up at the dealership the next day to finalize the purchase and he said he couldn't sell the vehicle at that price and increased the price by almost $1,000.

UPDATE: 
To Curry Honda's credit, General Sales Manager, Brian Dominick did contact me the shortly after the incident and personally assisted me with the purchase of my vehicle at the original agreed upon price.",-1
"231",2,"I brought my car here for a simple oil change, and i won't be back.

First, an oil change is a pretty basic bit of maintenance, but they managed to burn more than 1.5 hours doing it. I could have downloaded instructions, gone to the auto parts store to get oil and a filter, and changed my own oil faster than that. Now i understand why so many people brought hours upon hours worth of work to do while their car was serviced. Some people had taken over whole booths and set up a mini office for themselves.

Second, the waiting area is filthy. My (toddler) son spent most of that 1.5 hours crawling around and exploring the carpeted waiting area, and within minutes his hands and knees were literally black with filth. There was a guy wandering around with a broom and dust pan, so i guess that's the extent to which they bother cleaning.

Third, every single piece of documentation i've ever gotten for my car says that i only need oil changes every 10k miles. Beaverton Toyota slapped a sticker on my windshield informing me that my next oil change is needed in 3,750 miles. Toyota says i can go 10k miles, but this dealership wants me back sooner, to waste another 1.5 hours of my time, just to change my oil that should be good for another six thousand miles? No.

And lastly, my favorite part of the whole thing: I was there near lunchtime, and at one point, gazing out the window, i saw a peculiar sight. A new car, for sale, rolled into the lot and parked. Two dealership employees stepped out, take-out lunch bags in hand, and walked back into the dealership. So if you're test-driving a car here and it smells a little bit like McDonalds, you'll know why.

I don't know where the next-closest Toyota dealership is, but when my car needs routine maintenance again, i won't be wasting my time or money on Beaverton Toyota.

(Why two stars, you ask? Because their waiting area is surprisingly large and comfortable. There's a cafe-like area, and a room with diner-esque booths, and a counter with computers in case you didn't bring your own laptop. So if, for some reason, you have no choice but to bring your car to a dealership where the employees use the merchandise as a lunch taxi and they never mop the floor, you'll at least be able to set up shop, work, use the internet, and otherwise be productive while they take 3x longer than necessary to tend to your car. Just don't walk barefoot.)",-1
"232",1,"Not good at all. Service lacking food very average too many other decent choices in the area. No Italian feeling to this place at all. Like a bar that had an afterthought to try and serve Italian food.  Won't be back",-1
"233",1,"Aweful Aweful Aweful service!!!! . Rude hostess, she was dismissive and didn't care for our business so we went elsewhere. Band sound great while I was there waiting on hostess for short period..",-1
"234",1,"Got a burnt bun. Wtf. The bun was also crusty and stale. It wasn't good at all, if I wanted shit food I would have gone to burger king",-1
"235",2,"Totally disappointing experience. The food was not that great and to top it off the waitress kept forgetting the drinks and pretty much was confused. What was surprising about the forgetfulness is the fact that the place was not even crowded. Once upon a time this location actually used to serve some pretty appetizing wings. I was super stoked to order the Garlic Parmesan Wings, but when the wings arrived I was like Where is the meat? then when I tasted the wings I was like Where is the flavor? The waitress even made a comment like you barely touched your wings....hmmm I wonder why. Anyone who knows me knows I usually devour wings, there was no devouring going on here. In fact I actually did not have much of an appetite. 

This Hooter's location definitely needs to make some major improvements, flavor wise and customer service wise. The only decent part about my experience was that I got to watch the basketball game and drink tap water. So that is not saying much.........Wish I had a better experience, but unfortunately I did not.",-1
"236",1,"I love Chick-Fil-A.  Their restaurants are always clean, with fast, polite service, and the food is yummy.  This particular CFA fails on every count.  What a dirty, confused, mess of a place.  Meh.  Go somewhere else.",-1
"237",2,"I've gone back & forth with some people on this, but I have to say Game On is a pretty awful sports bar.

It's always crowded, which is understandbale and there are a butt load of TVs, but for some reason you can only see or maybe two at a time.  There's no deals to rave about and I've never had anything that blew my mind on the menu. It looks a lot cooler than I think it actually is.

The batting cage is pretty original, but this seems to be more of a result of location then anything within the bar.  Hit the Cask, Lansdowne or Beer Works.",-1
"238",1,"Worst experience ever! Bad service, ridiculously over priced.. Chana masala with no bhature was priced at $18.00.. we paid $90 for paneer and Chana sab Ji and 3 naans.. I would never recommend anyone going there.. wish we had read the reviews before hand and avoided..",-1
"239",2,"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about this place. I went with friends who raved about it and I was underwhelmed. Since this place is trendy and popular we waited 45 minutes, which I wouldn't have minded if the food made it worth it. I tried both my burger and my husband's. Both were on the dry side and not super flavorful.

Yes, the truffle fries and shakes are good and yes, they have beer. But this is a burger place and the burgers are sub-par. I would prefer P.Terry's or even Five Guys any day of the week.",-1
"240",1,"If I could give a zero star rating I would. 
Here is my story: My car had the engine light on so I went to them for service. They took the car and said it needs $1400 to change the radiator and some diagnosis fee. Fine. They did it and I paid. When I went to pick up the car, I drove for 1 minute and the engine light went back on. I came back but my advisor Nick was busy and asked me to hold. I asked around for help. A really kind advisor named Chris offered his help and checked the car for me. He found out that the engine oil was low and added oil immediately for me. He apologized even he wasn't my advisor for the repair. He said he doesn't take that issue lightly as the engine oil low problem is a very easy issue that should totally have been fixed before I come for the car. I appreciated his help. 
I was angry and I went to the advisor Nick, and he said ""oh the engine oil was low but the problem that you came in for has been fixed."" He did not apologize as if he would only help with what I came in for. Ridiculous!
Another issue on the engine appeared again after less than two hours driving away. The accelerator starts jerking. I returned to the shop. The next day, they called and said the engine quil has failed and I need to pay another $900 to have them replaced. I explained the whole thing about them not fixing my engine issue previously but they said they understood but this is another issue. 
I refused to pay the $900 on top of the $1400 that I already paid. I believe that I'm being ripped off and I would like to return to the Sudbury BMW to have all the issued dealt. Then this guy Bryan, who is the new advisor assigned to me, says that even if I don't wanna have it fixed there, I still need to pay for $152 of diagnosis fee. But I have on the first issue, they didn't properly detect the problem. They can't just keep on charging people diagnosis fees every time customers come back on issues that they didn't fix. 
It's totally none sense and I will not ever go back to this place. No one should!",-1
"241",1,"I finally tracked someone down and they came out to the house only to tell me they were not able to sand and restain my floors as the previous sales person said they could (2 months ago!). So that visit was a bust. I wait another week (and he was 30 minutes late) and Rick L brings me out laminate samples to look at that he said could keep me around the $1400 I was looking to spend. So I pick one out and he send me an estimate 3 days later that it will be $2,300!!",-1
"242",1,"I have been a fan of Stanford's at all their locations for a long time. Unfortunately, I visited this location recently and had a terrible experience. I was first seated at a table that was filthy, the table itself did not look like it had even been wiped down after the previous customer. The seat also felt dirty and there were food items at my feet. The service was very slow (I was only given one glass of water and it was never refilled?) and when a did receive my order it was regular chicken rather than the buffalo chicken I specifically ordered. After waiting for a long time I just ate the item I didn't order. When the server finally stopped by, I mentioned the error and was told very quickly that there was no credit given once an item was consumed. I was not looking for free food, just an acknowledgement or apology for the mistake (or mix up). 
I do plan to visit again as I hope this was an isolated very bad experience.",-1
"243",1,"Rip off!
This has got to be the only place in the southern US that charges for iced tea refills. $3 ea for the 3 teas I had. Was shocked when I got the bill but the bartender said that's what they do and stuck to it.  Food wasn't that great and service was really slow. Won't ever go here again...",-1
"244",2,"This place is nooooo bueno. I live down the street and am sad to say I can't go back! How can food be super salty and bland at the same time??",-1

"246",1,"My wife and I just had a dinner there for her best friend's birthday, and it ended up making me signing up for an account here to leave this review...

My wife ordered a salmon there and I ordered a 10 oz. Filet Mignon. As soon as the waiter took our order, he advised me to order some other sides with it since they don't give you any side on their main dishes. I was really surprised to hear a  restaurant selling a $40 plus Filet Mignon without giving you any supplementary sides. Anyway, I ordered some fries that turned out to be very salty and not crispy at all. 

As for my wife's salmon; I made a mistake by forgetting to tell the waiter that my wife was pregnant... when the salmon came, it was really raw inside(my wife actually said it was like salmon sashimi). Since it was my own mistake, I just politely asked the waiter to bring it back to the kitchen and cook it longer, I even apologized to him for not mentioning about my wife's pregnancy at the first place. The waiter then apologized back and took it back to the kitchen for over 10 minutes, and when he took it back to us, we knew they had cooked it for sure since it actually shrunk a size(or two), so we thought the salmon should be fine. However, as she cut it open, it was still red and raw inside... just like before...  Therefore, I had to ordered some mashed potatoes for my wife because the only thing she could eat there was those salty french fries....

Overall, the food quality really depends on what you order there. The fries and salmon we ordered were in no way up to the standards of such restaurants, and our friends made a joke of their broccoli side and called it ""baby broccoli"", but their mashed potatoes were really to die for. Our friend actually said it was ""better than sex"".

As for the restaurant itself, I really think it's more of a place for people to drink than to eat decent food. To me, it was more like a night club than a restaurant, because of the loud music they put on there, and the customers they had that were shouting. I would not recommend this restaurant to people that desired a romantic and elegant meal with their love ones.",-1
"247",1,"This is easily the worst Steak'n'Shake I've ever been to. 

Steak'n'Shake is known for their ability to turn tables quickly, but it's apparent that this location is having an identity crisis. 

The hosting area where all the menus are kept was in shambles. Somehow, a side of french fries were discarded onto of a pile of menus and no one seemed to care. The host had just sat another table, but when he saw us waiting, he made a sharp 90 degree turn and went straight to the back. So we waited. And waited. Then made obvious eye contact with this guy as he was conspicuously hiding behind a counter.

Finally, after a line had formed, he sat us. 

It only took two minutes of looking at the menu to decide our orders. But it took fifteen minutes before our server, Ieshia, ever showed her face. We could see in the back from our booth, and we made eye contact with this women several times. She would stand in the door frame of the kitchen and just stare at us, then turn around and disappear. Two other tables were seated immediately after us and they, too, were waiting for someone to stop by their table. A table of two gentlemen finally gave up and walked out. The table across from us had a mother with two small girls, she got up and complained to someone.

As we were getting ready to leave and head somewhere else, Ieshia finally showed up. I no longer cared for eating there, but my husband wanted to stick it out. Our order was simple. Two waters. Two patty melts with extra Frisco sauce and once with cheese fries.

The food took another 10 minutes, so by the time we started eating, we had been there for almost 30 minutes. We wanted milk shakes to go, so we placed our order when the food was dropped off. One Oreo Mint milkshake and a Strawberry Banana milkshake. Ieshia even asked if I wanted the Strawberry Banana milkshake separated or blended. I said blended.

Well, the food didn't last long, since we inhaled it. It was standard Steak'n'Shake fare - greasy goodness. But then we waited and waited and waited for these to-go milkshakes. Finally,my husband went to the counter to pay while I waited in the booth. I was getting up, ready to walk out and just forget the milkshakes when some other women came up to us and handed them over. Without saying a word, she just shoved them in our hands.

When I looked down, I noticed I had the wrong milkshake. Not only was it the wrong size ( we ordered smalls),but it was a Chocolate Covered Strawberry, not Strawberry Banana like I ordered. I contemplated for a split second of having them remake the milkshake with the correct order, but at this point. I was done. We just walked out.

The food is alright, but Ieshia and her gold glitter eye makeup completely ruined the meal. I know working here isn't anyone's glamorous dream job, but jeez, everyone here acted like they would rather be poked in the eyes with dull rusty spoons.

In total, we spent and HOUR at this God-forsaken hell hole disguised as Steak'n'Shake. Save your $10 and go somewhere else.",-1
"248",2,"I was excited to return to McCray's Tavern after having a wonderful 1st experience. The 2nd was not so wonderful. A friend and I sat on the patio and ordered a couple of beers and app. I finally received mine after multiple tries. My friend however received hers and didn't look at it until I got mine. There were 2 DEAD fruit flies in her beer, floating on top and not moving. When we showed the server he said he didn't think that they could do anything but would check. He instead brought back a spoon and coaster and that there was nothing they could do. Shocked I stated that they were obviously fruit flies which are usually indoors and around bars! He said there bar didn't have fruit flies. We finished our food and left. Looking back We should of talked to a manager. I am so disappointed in the service and lack of customer service. Thank you McCray's I will find a new neighborhood bar.",-1
"249",2,"Not what I expected. My tour guide confessed that it was his first day and that explains his hurried style and inability to control the crowd. Clearly, he thought we traveled all the way out there just for the free beer. Not really. 

Would have preferred it a bit more hands-on, and less like a frat boy shouting at my mom across a gym. Oh well. At least the beer was good.",-1
"250",1,"Where do I begin with my less than enjoyable experience. Two adults and one child for lunch. Total of 5 sodas, 3 appetizers, 3 lunch plates. Not so much as a glass was bussed from our table. It was not busy. Several servers also paraded by carrying empty trays but ignored our table piling up with empty dishes. The order of sushi was requested to have the hot sauce on the side which our server ensured us would not be a problem. It came with it on the sushi rolls. It was sent back and took a full 20 minutes to return. The multiple requests for sweet and sour sauce finally arrived, at the end of the meal. Food was fine and the hostess was very friendly and welcoming. The entire experience was diminished due to the seriously poor service. Our concerns were expressed to the hostess upon leaving. Something seriously missing with the waitstaff.",-1

"254",2,"I have been to sooo many hotels and I am shocked to see the quality of breakfast. It's horrible. If I were you, either I would eat out or not eat at all. The hotel is dated overall.
Not bad but nothing to attract me to come again.
The beds were alright. Not many people to help clean your tables or attend to you @ breakfast & for some reason everyone keeps on staring at you!
Don't understand why everyone was super loud & kept on talking in their own language without any courtesies 
for the others. My daughter is learning this language in her school. But to be surrounded by everyone speaking a foreign language & not English was really annoying.
This hotel will never get my business again:(",-1

My family and I always get the same menu items but this time the meat was really dried out and instead of lots of herbs and mixed greens in my fatoush salad I got wilted Romaine and no side of bread. We always share the 4 falafel and it was like eating three day old dried-out falafel cardboard. It was all SO bad! I was supposed to go there for lunch today with a girlfriend and had to pick a new place because this place is cancelled.",-1
"256",1,"ALLERGY, CLEANLINESS and RUDENESS ISSUES. Food is very average and people working there are mean. In Example. There is a sign that says let them know if you have an allergy before you order. I have an onion allergy and I told the very unfriendly woman working there about it The sandwich maker than proceeded to make my sandwich wearing the same gloves he had touched onions with. When I told the lady about it she rudely said ""If your so allergic to onions you should not be eating out "" I eat out all the time and order from many local places. I have always been accommodated until I went to the New York Deli. Also there is no point in wearing gloves if you don't bother changing them enough",-1
"257",2,"Ouch, what a bust. Avoiding one star simply because they are brand new. Friday night, 530pm, so they were fairly busy, no wait to sit, but a looooong wait for service. And the food and drink? Overpriced and pretty terrible.

Mai Tai tasted like the juice from a maraschino cherry jar. And for $9 it was about 80% ice.

Avocado taco was fine. But $6 for a small taco and it was the happy hour price. 

Crab cakes were overfried and basically just crunchy balls of oil. Two tiny bits, and again $6 at happy hour.

Had the Banh dot com, a take on a banh no and we couldnt even finish it. The tofu was bland and tasteless. The carrot slaw, just as bland. The large stack of cilantro stems and two jalape├▒o slices didnt help. Worst oart was the soggy hoagie like bread. Not the crusty roll you expect from a banh mi. On top of having to flag down a server any time we wanted to order, it was just a bad time. 

Plus the staples sticking out of the wall that snagged my coat and the blaringly loud Jay-Z music made the whole experience a complete mess. Won't be coming back.",-1
"258",1,"I really did not enjoy TomTom and would not recommend it to anybody.  The menu was unexciting and the food proved to be even more disappointing.  We started off with a whole-steamed cauliflower for roughly $9 that had a sprinkling of cheese on it but was otherwise completely devoid of seasoning or creativity.  Then we moved on to trying the tacos - the ""trailer-park"" taco comes on limp white bread and it is not clear from the menu that this is how it comes - quite interesting but not a desirable platform for a taco - tastes like it sounds like it would.  I can't even fathom why anybody thought it sounded like a good idea.  My friend ended up ordering ""bruschetta"" which literally was avocado on toast - nothing more.  It is frustrating to pay to eat  at restaurants for food you can replicate and improve upon at home for a fraction of the price.  I miss Noche!!",-1
"259",2,"Okay, so I visited their downtown location on busy ol' Robson street for the first time a few nights ago. Me and my guy were super pumped for ramen that night and like I couldn't even. So we drove across town in pure anticipation to try something new off their menu (because we enjoyed the West 4th location). We paid for parking and skipped down to the restaurant happy as could be to have some serious ramen time. But sadly one of the workers gave us some attitude in the way she talked to us, though we were being perfectly respectable. It was only ONE staff member that it took to dampen the mood and excitement. :( She just really made us feel like a bother and was giving us a bit of attitude instead of making our dining experience feel enjoyable. My guy also felt this right away and I could see the dinner was not going to be as fun basically by the way we were greeted. But other workers were awesome and sweet. I don't know, man. Customer service is tricky to work in, I know. But please be friendly at least and not like we are a total bother. The food was very good however....not incredibly filling but tasty. I like how much control the customers get over how their ramen is prepared. But yeah.",-1
"260",1,"BARF!!!!!  Seriously, the WORST food experience in all of Austin. We love to try new and different foods in Austin and around the world. This was disgusting and not because it was Ethiopian. The food was beyond over cooked, poorly prepared, and very very low quality meats. Nothing was fresh and the service was a D- at best. They forgot our beverages and took forever to even place an order & the place was only 1/2 full. Sadly, the people working there were nice. 

OH and it was so hot on a winter's day inside the joint that our server was dripping sweat all over us. HURRRRRRRRRRLLLL. Then when we asked for fresh air, he was so thankful. It was like the owners were punishing him for something he did and forced him to work in an oven until a customer pleaded for air. 

We would NEVER go back!  We looked at these reviews before going and thought it had a shot.....but were sadly shocked by the poor nature of the whole experience.",-1

"264",1,"My husband and I have been going to Barley Swine for years, back when it first opened in the old South Lamar location, and both Barley Swine and Odd Duck have always been on our favorites list. I'm really disappointed to say that our experience last night may explain why it's easy these days to get a table there on a Saturday night without a wait or reservation.

I'm used to paying a lot of money for a small amount of high quality food, but the amount of food we received for the $90 Chef's Tasting prix fixe menu was so small it was almost comical. 

The difference may be due to how they're now serving the Chef's Tasting menu. Previously, the food used to be served on a communal bowl or plate that diners would share and eat out of. While the course portions were smaller than the regular menu (about roughly half), you still felt really full by the end of the meal. This time, each course was portioned onto separate plates for each of us, but each dish was much much MUCH smaller. There were 11 total courses, and 6 of the 11 courses were literally about 1 bite each (some were even smaller than a normal bite!). Additionally, for some reason the dishes I was served were consistently smaller than my husbands, sometimes looking about 1/2 to 1/3 the size of his portion, which seemed really odd and vaguely sexist, even though it was probably a coincidence.

What we received for $90/person:
1. Green tomato tostada - This was smaller than even an amuse-bouche portion, more like half of a bite.
2. Popcorn custard, gulf ceviche - This was my favorite dish. The custard was silky and had subtle flavors, but my portion was half the size of what my husband received. Both were served inside a small cup about the size of a large egg, but the custard only filled a small portion of the bowl.
3. Chicken skin, deviled egg - We received about 1 bite each, but this made sense due to the intense richness of this course. This course was one of my favorites.
4. Shishito pepper, spicy chicken fat - We received 2 small peppers each. I didn't really like this dish, so I didn't mind not getting more of it.
5. Zucchini, arugula, beet jus - The jus was delicious, but we barely got a taste (about 2 spoonfuls) because the jus didn't even cover the bottom of the bowl.
6. Heirloom tomato tart - My least favorite course of the night, both in flavor (didn't taste very unique) and in quantity. We each received 1/4 of a tiny tart, literally about the size of a quarter. It felt so stingy that this left us wondering what they did with the other half of the tart.
7. Snapper in the husk, corn, rice - This was delicate and delicious, but again my portion was half the size of what my husband received, about 2 tiny bites worth.
8. Smoked duck tamale, peach salsa, basil - This was a deconstructed tamale. It was very tasty, and the portion made sense for a tasting menu. No complaints on this one.
9. Aged Akaushi ribeye, potato, green bean - Was extremely flavorful and delicious, but the portion was approximately the size of 1 slice of fajita meat. By this point, we were disappointed because we could tell we were going to leave the restaurant still hungry, which is rare for me because I get full really easily.
10. Sorrel snow, strawberry, yogurt, coriander - This was my favorite dessert. It was light and summery.
11. Chocolate & shiitake crepe cake, fig, lavender - This had decent flavors. The presentation was really pretty.

Needless to say, while we will undoubtedly come back, we will *never* order Barley Swine's Chef's Tasting menu again. As a not-so-wise man once said: ""Fool me once, shame on...shame on you. Fool me...you can't get fooled again.""",-1

Like, you can't wear fucking timbs? But your establishment is in New England, where is snows, at a fucking bowling alley... where you are going to take your shoes off. 

- The members of their staff are extremely unpleasant, they have no concept of good customer service practices. 

I'm not sure if the bouncers are pissed that they failed the police academy and are now doing security for a bowling alley, but take that up with Jesus, and not the customers. 

I'm not sure who managers this place, but corporate offices need to take a good look at who they are hiring for staff. Not only are they discriminatory, they are extremely rude, disgruntled and straight up assholes. I will definitely not be coming back to this place. 

Do yourself a favor, if you have a desire to bowl or play pool, go to Boston Bowl and if you're about the bar life, visit the other places around Fenway, except Bar Louie but that's another review for a later time.  smh.",-1
"266",2,"Holy S@?T does this place need a makeover.....I walked in there for the first time about 3 weeks ago .....I was so in the mood for a good salad bar and I knew this was where to go.......the salad wasn't bad at all really.....seemed fresh....tasted good.....but the place was dingy and old looking.....like bad......it didn't particularly look clean......the managers office was at the end of the counter with a curtain draped over it.....strange....just a really off atmosphere......didn't really seem particularly busy either.....which makes sense.....with panera around the corner who needs this old show........wrecking ball maybe???",-1

"268",1,"While this store may be great for someone who has a lot of time on their hands, if you are busy with life, then this may not be the store for you.  Based on my own experience, what the store may believe is good customer service, my opinion resonates there is a lack of communication within the store.  I brought in a little antique watch that was missing the crystal.  At first i was told it would be around $50 to replace.  They offered a cleaning of the watch to bring my total to $155.  They called me to let me know the final price with service would be $155 and the crystal would be $35.  I waited 10 days to hear from them, when i called, they were happy to inform me that the watch person was on vacation and that it would be an additional 10 days.  I informed them that information would have been good to have before i left my watch.  So now i'm not happy having to wait additional days.  The next day i receive a call asking me if i just want the crystal or if I want the servicing as well.  This went on for several days, with messages being left, and me returning calls with implicit requests of crystal only.  By now you are probably bored of reading this just as i was bored of going through it..  it was like a ""who's on first"" nightmare on a loop.  Bottom line, find another reputable jeweler, make sure you gather all the information from this jeweler should you be so brave as to go there and spend your hard earned money.",-1
"269",2,"Recently went here with my husband and a friend. We were impressed with the look of the restaurant. It was very simple and clean. The beers were decent. Nothing out of the world special, but good. Our server was great. 
The reason I'm giving this place 2 stars (wish I could do 2.5) is because of the food. Overall, it was lackluster. We ordered the mussels, pork belly, and the radishes to start. The mussels were good. Wish they served with more bread to lap up the sauce. It was a light creamy curry sauce and it was great. The pork belly itself was good. Our issue with the plate was the very strange garnishes. While raw sage leaves? No one is going to eat that. The radishes were not edible. It was incredibly offensive to my pallet! First off, they were raw which we didn't expect. The smoked butter they served was just bad...real real bad. It was so over smoked and salty. Not edible. And again with the garnish...crushed pistachios around the circle of radishes. How are you supposed to eat that? Spread the cold butter on the raw radishes and sprinkle the pistachios on top? Not one person at our table liked it and unfortunately we had to send it back. Next we got the fennel salad and pork cheeks. The salad was fine and the pork cheeks were ok. They were cooked fine, but the plating was a mess. Again very strange garnishes...flower petals and some sort of green leafy herb on big stems. Overall we loved the environment of the restaurant and the service was good. The food wasn't enough to make us ever want to come back.",-1
"270",1,"The worst experience I have ever had with any kind of eye care.    

The  doctor who gave the eye exam was slipshod, disorganized. and distracted. Every prescription he did for me was wrong, and every prescription was wrong because he did not test properly in the first place.   He rushed through the exam  - failed to ask about dilation,  failed to use a reading card etc - and shuttled  me in and out of the exam room at 2 min increments  (he was also ""examining"" several other patients during the same 15 min stint.).

On top of that, he engaged in aggressive sales practices - my understanding was the doctor was supposed to have no interest or financial stake in the sales of glasses/lenses.  But here, in front of me, he set the price of a very $$$$ glasses I did not need  - luckliy I was wary by that point and did not make the purchase.  He also spent more time explaining different payment options than he'd spent  actually  examining my eyes. 

The  prescription he gave me was a disaster - it made me naseous and dizzy .  I had to go back and have the part-time doctor make things right - which she did. But none of these problems should have happened in the first place.  

And there  was a run-around about whether I would be ""allowed"" to get a refund for  the pair of glasses I did get there -- based on the faulty prescription the doctor there had provided!!!  (They were also unable to locate one of my prescriptions, because it was never written up. Looks like the  doctor had, literally, phoned it in.)  I had to get very pushy to get basic good business  practice, and simple fairness, out of this shop.   I never dreamed getting an eye exam would lead to a situation so tense and adversarial, but there you are. 

You go to these places in good faith - expecting a competent eye exam by a competent practioner.   In my experience, the main doctor here operates in bad faith -- and is backed by a sales team that is aggressive and incompetent too.",-1

"272",2,"Come here with cash. A lot of cash.  An overpriced average tea that doesn't take card. 

I am in touch with my bubble tea and I won't be coming here again. 

Disclaimer: I had a GINORMOUS expectation since I googled best bubble tea in Vancouver (home of amazing Asian food) and this place came first for 2014. Plus, I also had to drive 20 mins to get here from where I stay.  Boyfriend and I were on a chinese food pilgrimage in Vancouver. We live in Seattle so we are somewhat deprived of solid chinese food. After a long day of delicious chinese meals, we want to chase everything down with a perfect cup of bubble tea!

We ended up having hot milk tea with grass jelly and fresh persimmon drink with coconut jelly.  Neither is outstanding. They were good, but definitely not worth the 20 minute drive. 

The reason it is a solid 2 star though is the place only takes cash.  Really? You only take cash? We only had $3 Canadian dollars on us. We were surprised that she didn't take card and definitely wanted to pay her for drinks we had ordered, so we asked if the owner would take US dollars. 

She had a sheepish smile on and said yes but at par value.  I don't think we had much of a choice at that point.  Funny how that works, she wanted to save 5% credit card fee but found it completely acceptable to charge me 20%+ more for my drinks. I ended up paying US$9.75 for my two ok drinks. 

I would have felt much better if the owner at least has a credit card option but charge 5% more for transaction under certain amount of dollars like other hole in a wall places. 

Me no like getting jibbed :(",-1
"273",1,"Wow....honestly this place sucked from the time we walked in...

The host greeted us, not by saying ""welcome to BJs,"" but by asking if we had a rewards card. We said no so she told us to wait off to the side. After a very few uncomfortable moments of silence, another host motioned for us to follow him. 

The place was nice inside. Whatever--looked like every other bar/restaurant that seems to be popular nowadays. Waitress showed up promptly, asked us what we wanted, so we got drinks and calamari appetizer. The picture on the menu (hah, I know, pictures on a menu) looked pretty good. The menu was huge. I'm not joking--the burgers were broken down into categories based on which piece of equipment you wanted it cooked on...not necessarily a bad thing...but strange. Everything served here is frozen food that could be prepared at home.

Well--when we got that calamari...it looked nothing like the photo. It was $10, but probably had three or four bites of calamari. It was a very, very small plate of food. 

I never send back food. I work in a kitchen and I know how annoying that can be. But...this wasn't right. My wife asked if this was a normal portion, apparently it was. I told her we didn't want it. $10 is quite a bit of mula for a measly portion of food. 

Instead, we just ordered some food to try and hurry this trip up. We were both pretty ready to get out of there, but we were also hungry. Sadly--I think our calamari (which say on our table for awhile) was served to another table. Gross.

Anyways--we get our food and it's not horrible. I had the jalape├▒o burger, which came with fried jalape├▒os. The burger had only a couple of jalape├▒os, but two different sauces...kinda weird but whatever. The Asian salad was alright as well. I guess the mandarin oranges and sesame seeds made it Asian.


Whatever--this place just didn't do it for me. The staff was bad, the food was alright and the best part of our experience was leaving the restaurant.",-1
"274",2,"Good wings and decent burgers. 

Definitely a family-friendly restaurant for local Apopka families. I'm fairly certain the first time we visited last summer, e.v.e.r.y.o.n.e stared at us.... ""Who are they?""  We could feel the eyes on us. Our server was less than attentive. 

After six months in the community and several visits later, people no longer stare and servers are more attentive. Guess we had to earn our stripes.

They do not test their blood work they have to send it off and happened to send my blood work out and i had no relief over night and went home with no answers. They seemed just as clueless as i was. They told me they'd label my blood work ""Stat"" but after calling twice and being told they were too busy to talk to me and that the Dr hadn't reviewed my results we finally found out they sent my blood work to the WRONG LAB? Once they called me at 5pm the NEXT DAY they just had some random girl call and say my results were normal. Didn't get to speak to a Dr about what I should do next or what might be my diagnosis.

However they charged is the rice plate and forced us to take the food because we ordered it... As they gave it to us nearly an hour after we order and was leaving..and wanted to scold and argue with us because we could not be patient..

The falafel wrap is okay, but drowned in too much tahini and not fried to order.  There are no pickled vegetables or anything ""Mediterranean"" in the wrap.  $7.99 gets you just a wrap with no side.   Their hot sauce is Texas Pete or something of that sort.

"281",2,"I wish we had the old store back and the old crew back.
1.  This store is too big--if you are on crutches it is almost impossible to navigate. If you are old, have health problems, etc--it is really difficult.  Then the elevator is set up so that you can not exit into the parking lot from the same door as you entered the elevator in.    If you have handicapped parking, you have to walk around the esculator  to go up or to go down. 

There is too much duplication of product--there is not a whole lot more now than there was in the old store which probably had a foot print about half the size--the difference is the bigger deli, the meat department and the bakery--all of which cost a lot more now.  Aisle signs can be wrong and you have to walk forever to find the the product when this happens.
2.  I hate the way  items ring up--you never know if you are getting the special prices until they ring in the final item and then you have to go some place to check and then round up someone at the service desk to give you your money back.  I would guess that 60% of the time or more, there are mistakes in my charges, one time worth $23 in over rings, wrong prices, missed half price markers.  This costs me precious time to then go to the service desk and the corrections made.  CHECK YOUR RECEIPT if you are a bargain shopper.
3.  Prices are just too high.  So they have gone in and created these programs for their regular shoppers like Just 4 u which supposedly gives you specials on things that  you regularly buy.    Those special prices are about what I pay at other stores in the area. Their half price meat, the meat that is about to hit its expiration date--sometimes is a bargain, but mostly, it brings the prices down to what I pay at FM.
One time I bought 3 lbs of cherries and was told I had saves $23 on them--they had rung them up at 9.99 a pound and then discounted it to $2 something a pound.

"287",1,"Devastated! After 9 years of trusting Banfield Tigard with our little girl, they let us down in the biggest way possible.

We had suspicions that Banfield's diagnosis for what was ailing our girl was missing the mark. They treated her first for a UTI, then kennel cough, but she wasn't getting well. So we chose to get a second opinion.

The new Vet did tests and took time with her that I hadn't seen from Banfield. A few days later we got hit with the results from her tests: she had cancer of the lungs. They began treatment immediately and ran a more in-depth test to find out the extent, which confirmed our worst nightmares. 

Just 3 weeks after leaving Banfield, the Vet told us that the cancer was too aggressive to treat with medicines. Even with the more involved treatments, that we couldn't afford, her quality of life would be poor and we would only get maybe 6 more months with her.

Our Wellness Plan with Banfield auto-renewed a month before we had to let her go. We plead with Banfield to cancel our plan, but was always met with opposition; we could either pay full price for the services rendered following renewal (Mis-diagnosed tests and visits), or continue to pay until our contract was up.

The night didn't start off very well when my girlfriend was given a dirty plate, and when I say dirty I don't mean there was a little bit of water on it or something. There was literally cheese smeered on it. After that I thought the food was subpar. I got the pork and it was covered in some sort of breading that fell right off immediately. The peppercorn steak was drenched in peppercorn and very chewy.

He guided me to the bubbles as the perfect compliment.  Perhaps my expectations were too high. I was so so so disappointed in the chicken.  It was flavorless.

The Margaritas were $4.00 and wings $.60ea
No problem with the food quality but when the bill came wings were $.75 and my 2 margaritas were $9.50. It's not a great deal of money but.... you know.
The server couldn't fix the bill but offered to have me speak with her Manager. I took the offer.
I explained that I had indeed ordered my 2nd drink before happy hour ended @ 6:PM

A 25 minute wait for a table is expected with a place that is so popular, but to then twiddle our thumbs for 5 minutes waiting for a menu, then another 10 minutes for someone to take an order, then another 25 minutes for brunch to arrive is unacceptable, especially when one of our party didn't even get her meal when the rest of us did (""It's coming!"" was the terse response to our query about the whereabouts of the missing waffles). Coupled with an omnipresent cacophony that made conversation difficult, if not (at times) impossible, this was a very disappointing first visit to a restaurant that I had been highly anticipating. I might give Medina another try, but it won't be for awhile, and the next may be my last visit if the service doesn't improve vastly. We'll see!",-1

Advice: Arrive early. By the time I filled out the intake form and was on the table, it was 10 minutes past my appointment time. The lady giving me my 60 minute massage did not adjust for this, and after 50 minutes a kitchen timer went off and that was it.

I asked for a deep tissue massage, and the deep tissue part was delivered without regard for finesse. That in and of itself wouldn't stop me from recommending the business; I have a high pain tolerance, and each masseuse has their own style. I did feel uncomfortable, however, being called ""m'lady"" repeatedly by my masseuse. Also, the last couple of minutes of my massage consisted of my masseuse grabbing handfuls of my upper traps and grinding. Painful. It could have been fine if she'd taken the time to transition into a less stressful type of massage before finishing, but she really stuck with her timer, which again was not set for the 60 minutes for which I'd paid.

They seemed to have a major attitude problem with us as soon as we stepped foot in the door. The ""preppy"" bartender/manager didn't say hello or anything to us nor did the female employee standing beside him behind the bar. We just kind of stood there until finally a hostess seated us. Ironically, while we were waiting for our food to come out (which took forever), I noticed the same staff members behind the bar break their necks to greet and seat other guests that in MY OPINION ""looked more like them"". What's that all about??? 

The waitress was horrible and I've had better burgers. Our service sucked SO bad, I left her a $1.00 tip and that may have been too much! 

This place is so not happening :-(. Too many other places to go in Buckhead to have to deal with this kind of foolishness.",-1
"307",1,"This is one of the best hotels my family has stayed at in Orlando.  We travel with our dogs and it is nice to stay at hotel where you don't mind walking on the carpet versus what we normally stay in.  The others in the area charge an outrageous fee to have a pet from between $100-$150 so this location with their free pets policy is a god send.  

The room we selected was a king room and the room was one of the largest that I have seen.  It had a private seating area with a TV and desk.  There was a small bar area with a refrigerator that came in handy.  The only thing i wished was that the bar had a small sink.  The bathroom was huge and well lit.

Ok I am updating my review because of a somewhat expensive item being left.  

Within hours of checking out the hotel was called about an item being left in the bathroom.  To report an item you have to go to a website and fill out a form and wait for an email and then confirm the email finally you get a message they will contact you about it.  Well, 2 weeks later no word from the hotel and called to hear that the item is lost forever.  Now I don't want to accuse someone of taking it, but the item just vanished.

It was a Clinique sonic brush and soap.  While this item cost only $90 it should still have been returned.  The hotel was notified right after we left.  There is no excuse for this to have happened.  I must say I have stayed at cheaper places and have left more expensive items and get them back.  So lesson to self you don't always get what you pay for.  

To the individual that has the sonic brush without the charger let me know and I will forward it to you

We will defiantly not be back.",-1

"310",2,"I ate at Tavern in the Square for the second time yesterday. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar.  At first the bartenders seemed like they would be attentive, but that was not the case. We ordered lunch and drinks. These were served to us, but once our drinks were empty they never offered another drink.  I watched one bartender walk by 5 times and look at our empty drinks, but never once did he ask if we wanted anything else.  My boyfriend had to ask for our check instead of it being offered to us. Honestly we would have had a second drink, but were never offered one and should not have to ask especially when the bar was not crowded at all. The food was actually really good. I had the classic macaroni & cheese, and my boyfriend had the candied bacon and bleu cheese burger.  This is the only reason I gave two stars. It's a shame that the service was so bad cause we typically spend a lot out at restaurants and return to places with good service. Next time we're in the area we will try another place.",-1

Old Review:::::: 
Not gonna eat here. I can't stand when your ordered and someone in the background says their gonna have to take it to go, we're closing in 3 minutes.  Door is wide open, tables are out and customers inside eating.   If this was my staff I would fire them for this.   I wanted a Buddha bowl anyway and they had no rice for it. So I left and did not order. Another 3 people walked in and left, probably told they were closed.   
I was going to spend $30 dollars and probably the other people would have spent $30-50 also. Loss of $60 before tax minimum. That's how businesses die.  I used to go to Lonsdale location 3 to 5 times a week x $30. Now live next to Dollarton and was so happy when I say you were opening here.  But now I'm just not feeling any gratitude to customers.  Spend my $90-$140 a week somewhere else and not be treated like customers are meaningless. What a bummer!!!!!",-1
"313",1,"My family has been ordering from this place like twice a week, well no longer.
I personally have never had their food until recently.
I ordered a sub and as soon as I opened it the smell was off, I looked inside and the color was all wrong.
We called them to see if they could return the sub or exchange it and the woman who answered refused to do either, she then slammed the phone down.

I ordered vegetable wrap with no cheese, but I got cheese. I got dark roast black, and I got milk in my black coffee. And I looked through my DD Perks app and couldn't find any complain button.

I had to go in THREE times to sign documents that ""they missed"" the day we purchased the vehicles. To make it even more funny the woman that was in there the same day as Us purchasing a vehicle was in there doing the SAME THING. Signing documents they ""forgot"". They just want a quick sale and are careless. Completely un organized and worse than the typical car dealer. Wouldn't recommend going to this dealership. Find your car elsewhere.",-1
"316",1,"I recommend that you go elsewhere. I placed an order of shirts that I needed for a bodybuilding competition. I was ensured that they would arrive no later than a certain date. The shirts were ready two days later than I was told. 
After communicating all day to meet and pick up the shirts I came to find that one of the shirts was printed with a stain. I was then told to just try to wash the shirt to see if the stain would come out. As a business owner that claims to deliver top quality he should not have delivered the dirty shirt in the first place. The adjustment should have been made immediately. I took the shirt home and lo and behold the stain did not come out. 
After returning from my competition which was in early July I asked if a new shirt could be mailed out to me since I had just moved to Killeen from Austin. I was reassured that I would receive a new shirt to my home in the mail. After about a month I contacted him being that I had not received my shirt. He said he did not have a tracking number for the shirt and would send out a new one. I asked for the tracking number to be sent to me for the second shirt that was mailed out. Several weeks later and two months after I have placed the initial order I have not received what I have paid for. I contacted him yet again for a tracking number or to just give me a refund for the price of the shirt. My emails are not responded to nor my calls answered. As someone that owns a business I make sure to always deliver the best customer service I can, and this my friends is not good customer service.",-1

Yo Chung's, y'all know it's illegal to forge the final amount on a CC receipt right? 

Ken the bitter server berated me as I poured myself water from pitchers set w/ self-serve plates at the buffet, which is what I was having. No sign or anything indicating that customers weren't to get their own water. 
It's a buffet for crying out loud. Ken barked at me rudely and only stopped by to refill my bf's water once. We're generous tippers but don't feel obligated at all in the rare case when the waiter is a fuckboy.

CC statement showed more charged than what I signed for. Called them 2 weeks later, claimed they couldn't refund since ""end of the month has passed"". Offered to mail me the difference but ""we can't do anything if it gets lost in the mail"". Sure, so would you even truly mail it?
Gary didn't even apologize, just made some BS excuse about how my card number was similar to another so there was a mix-up. 
Shady business.

I get back to my place, open the bag, and note the fairly small container of rice, about the size of a fist. Eh, whatever. I open up the container and find it less than half full. Really? Plus, the shrimp wasn't crispy, and the rice noodles were chewy. I could have found much better options for half the price in the food court in Cambridgeside Galleria. I won't be returning.",-1

"326",2,"I went to Sissy K's Thursday night because one of my buddy was in town. We was at Hong Kong and we swung by Sissy Klan. It was around 1:30am. There was fairly a lot of people on a Thursday night. I hung out at the bar on first floor. A light skin black girl walk by me and went to the bar and her friend (white) sat on a chair few feet next to me. The LSBG turn around to leave and she looked at me. She immediate made a racial stereotype of Asian people. Mind you I am an Asian descendant. It was unprovoked. I wasn't surprise by her comments just because this is Boston. I smile and just say 'ok......at least we made more money than you.' Another buddy of mine, saw what happen and pull me to the side and told me along the line that this girl was on to something. I tried to mind my own business. This LSBG looked at me and walked toward me again. She made the same racial stereotypes of asian people a few more times. Again, unprovoked! I smile and say that's funny.  It's weird that she's making racial stereotype comments of another race when she's black!!

What happen afterward is a confusion. I was just standing there with my hands in my pocket. From my personal account was that I saw the white girl fell on the floor, but from what my buddy say the white girl who sat on the chair try to swung at me but she fell on to the ground with the LSBG and both of them were on the ground for some reason. Unbelievable! Base on the whole incident I gathered, it looked like I was attack because of racial bias toward Asian American. They tried to get up but the bouncer immediately dragged them away. I'll give them props for quickly deescalate the situation. All this instant, are the fault of the establishment. The bartender should stop serving alcohol to these racist girls or kids. The bartender on the first floor, tall lanky guy was rude and he had every opportunity to remove the racist black girl before it happens.

Update 6/21 - Talked to my buddy who was next to me that night, the bartender on the first floor told the customers that I instigate the whole incident. It looks like he was trying to cover a hate crime taking place.",-1
"327",2,"I can only review the Happy Hour menu and the bar this time out.
In comparison to Pastini's ( I gave those folks 2 stars) the food is better. He Who Must Be Obeyed (hereinafter HWMBO) had the Margherita pizza embellished with some ground sausage and the draft Hefeweizen. 

I had the fried artichokes and a Stella (my first ever).

We were well pleased with the items we ordered though I wish that the Stella had a little bit more snap to it. Why the British love the stuff is a mystery to me.

The beverages and food order came with some very tasty bread sticks which when paired with the beer and my artichokes was satisfying. The artichokes were a surprise. They were the marinated ones that come in a jar, Panko'd and lightly fried. This produced a very interesting appetizer and delightful nosh.

HWMBO was enamored of the crispy crust and was looking forward to ordering it again. So, we went again...and that is when the wheels came off the cart at least s far as the bar.

I strayed away from the draft beers and ordered a margarita. The glass came to me with black plastic flecks in the bottom and the triple sec was laid on with a heavy hand...sicky sweet. We took this as a sign and chose to try again another time...maybe.

My advice - stick with the draft beer and Happy Hour menu. Above all, choose carefully.

My ice maker still isn't working and it's been over month. We had to throw out so many groceries.

Communication between the serviceman seems to be non-existent because I kept being told different things by different people about their protocol and when they'd be in for service. They seriously need a better communication system. I think that's their biggest downfall.

Nicola's has good sauce which is a must for an Italian restaraunt, but beyond that, they are pretty bad.  I think that the problem is that the owner uses really low end ingredients.  Their pizza toppings and stromboli fillings are barely eatable.  Their meatballs are the worst that I have ever had in my life and I really questioned what I was eating.  

I think that the most dissapointing thing about this place is that they are just cheap.  I ordered take out pizza a while back and ordered half sausage, pepper, onion and half plain cheese.  When my wife brought it home and told me how much it cost, I thought it was a mistake, turns out they charge you for the three toppings on the whole pizza even though they only put it on half.  

Come'on Nicola's owner, don't be cheap.  If there aren't toppings on half of the pizza, don't charge people for them.

"346",2,"My husband and I purchased the Groupon for this authentic Arabic cooking class for $42 per person. We were both very excited to attend since we've been to cooking classes before and had a blast, as well as learned a lot of things.

We had a hard time finding this place because we thought it'd be an establishment, turns out, it was just a house, which is fine. When we approached the house, Ahmad was sitting on his porch with another couple waiting for other students. He was a very pleasant man to talk with, and had a lot of knowledge about cooking.

When everyone had arrived, we went inside his home, and stood in his dining room area (chairs and tables were removed), we stood there for a good hour and a half. I was surprised that there were no chairs or something. There wasn't much participation involved, since there wasn't much to really do.  He had someone pit olives which seemed to be a pain in the ass, blend some lemon juice and garlic in a blender, and chop parsley and pick thyme. The students all looked around at each other sharing similar thoughts it seemed. In total, there were about 8 students.

A few questions were asked, but we felt like the answers weren't well answered.  One student asked ""where do you buy your salmon?"", he answered with ""Whole foods"", not that I have a problem with Whole Foods, but as a Chef and having been in the restaurant industry for 16 years, shouldn't you know of fresh, quality fish markets or places where people in that industry purchase their ingredients?  Anyway, it was a dull class, everyone was yawning and someone was feeling light headed from standing up the entire class, she had asked for a chair from outside on the porch, he insisted no chairs because he didn't want people to fall asleep (wonder why, it must've happened before?). 

The dishes that he made were salmon in a marinade (great flavors), roasted red pepper hummous (very delicious!), and a chick pea salad with the olives, roasted red peppers, thyme, and other spices (it was ok, chick peas needed to be soaked longer), as well as his own blend of lemonade.  A student asked how he made the lemonade, his answer was, ""just some fruits and lemon""...not impressed. I think if he taught his classes a bit differently, and had the students make their own dishes, it'd be much more exciting and enjoyable!

He usually charges $85/person, this class was definetly not worth $85, nor the $42 Groupon we had purchased. We really wanted to love this cooking class, but it was a big disappointment as the other Yelper experienced.",-1
"347",1,"Did someone just package a piece of poop? Did they take it, put it in a pretty package and everyone is buying the joke? This place is trying to look hip and cool but the food is equal to the fast food Chinese joint right up the street. At least that place is not putting its low grade fast food in a pretty box. They are being 100% about the food they serve.",-1
"348",1,"I was recommended this place because I like board games and heard that they had a selection to play while serving you food as well.

I loathed the place as soon as I stepped foot in the door. Loud, obnoxious music. A tiny, cramped space. Ugly, thrift store decor. I have no idea what they are trying to accomplish. They seem to be pandering to that same crowd that watches garbage like Big Bang Theory. Not real geeks. The geek sheik crowd. Hipsters, I guess. They had a a geeky movie on screen, but the music was way to loud to hear it. Of course the loud music made everyone yell at each other, so it was intolerably noisy. We wanted to play Survive, from the handful of games they had. Try teaching a game when you have to scream the rules to someone who is 6 inches away from you. The game was missing pieces, and sticky. There was no enough room on the table to eat and play. The waitress just handed me my food. No cutlery to speak of - ooh, edgy! Hip! The tables were basically picnic tables. The food was your basic pub food. Cheap and easy.

I could go on and on about how bad this place is. It is ironic that we were playing Survive, because all I could think of while ""experiencing"" this dump was that  I wanted to be rescued. At least the waitresses dressed like strippers, so there's that.",-1
"349",2,"This is a mixed review. Like many Americans I evaluate a Chinese restaurant on their fried rice, lo mein and General Tso's chicken. First the good. Their lo mein is near top notch and the General Tso's chicken is very good with large chunks of chicken and a generous portion. Now the bad. Their fried rice is some of the worst I've ever had. I don't know if the rice is undercooked to begin with or they leave it to dry out completely, but the end result is very dry almost crunchy fried rice. Fried rice is a staple at Chinese restaurants and they miss the mark by a mile. Service is good and prices are average, I'm sorry to say it but the good doesn't outweigh the bad, This is not one of my go-to Chinese places.",-1

"352",2,"My boyfriend and I discovered this restaurant about a year ago and have gone a few times since. We have really enjoyed the food, and we usually sit at the same table. We went to The Pub yesterday, and the experience was absolutely terrible. We sat for about 15-20 minutes without anyone even coming to get us drinks or ask about appetizers. The whole time, I sat and watched the guy that was going to wait on us just standing, laughing, and talking to another table while we waited. Eventually, he came over and asked us what we would like to drink. We ordered a Belhaven cheese dip and asked for just pretzels instead of veggies. He made a joke that veggies are for rabbits, and he doesn't blame us. He brought us out our drinks (with lemon when we said no lemon- wasn't that big of a deal) and the appetizer. Surprise! It had veggies. We did not see this waiter for the entire rest of the day after we ordered our meal. We ordered a Caesar salad and a ham and Swiss sandwich. When we ordered, there were hardly anyone in the place. We didn't get our meal until 50 minutes later I someone in the kitchen. Then, we had to wait an additional 20-30 minutes to get someone to pay attention to us to find our waiter so that we could check out! We were never offered a refill, although we watched our waiter and other waiters go to the tables surrounding us numerous times. Also, we never received an apology. My boyfriend and I are very understanding and patient people, but this was way too much. Our waiter basically said ""my bad"" when he finally came to give us the check. We tried to snag someone numerous times during our visit, but everyone just ran away so quickly you could 't get to them in time.",-1

In conclusion, I would not live here again.",-1

Not only did they CANCEL both of my children's appointments but my other child (without a billing error) with special needs needs follow up on a procedure they performed. All over $50. I will never bring my children there ever again nor would I recommend it to anyone. How could they cancel appointments for children that are in need of dental attention?",-1
"355",1,"Had I reviewed Shi Chi a week ago, they might have gotten 3 stars. However, after my experience this weekend, they were fully downgraded.

My husband and I decided to go there on Saturday night, thinking that we typically sit down easily there. Knowing it was Valentine's Day weekend, we called ahead and made resevations for 6:30pm for 2 people.

We arrived a couple minutes after 6:30 and were told it would be about 10 minutes. Our thinking was 'no big deal, it's busy.' Well, 35 minutes and a complaining stop to the host stand later, we were finally seated. 

Then, we waited nearly 15 minutes to see a waitress. We considered leaving multuple times, but knew we'd have to wait all over again somewhere else. We stayed and were finally greeted by our chef. 

The food was ok- about what you'd expect from a Japanese steak house. The hibachi dinners start with soup (broth with a few green onions and pieces of tofu) and salad (with ginger dressing and bacon bits). You also get a few pieces of shrimp appetizer, hibachi vegetables and rice (I always get the fried rice). I got the kobe (steak) and chicken, while my husband got steak and lobster with a thick, creamy sauce. 

The best part is that dessert is included. You get your choice of vanilla ice cream or pineapple sherbert. Delicious way to end the meal!

I have been there a handful of times before and had good experiences, but this one was pretty awful. I doubt we'll be back anytime soon.",-1
"356",1,"1 star is the least so that's what they get. Rude staff. Guacamole had more lettuce than anything else. Chicken was super dry and overcooked. Margaritas were almost warm, too sweet, not strong enough. Most of the food tasted ok but questionable at the same time. On the way out at bathrooms waiting in line, Looking in the kitchen we saw the chefs throwing lettuce at each other, pick up off the floor and place back in serving bin. GROSS. Then the waiter walks out of the kitchen. The owners should know that they have a great concept and location, but for all of the reasons above and the obvious depth of nastiness and cheapness that they point to, we will not be back.",-1

(The guy that has my 34's is in for a surprise when he goes on to put what he thinks are his 42's). I went in the next day level headed, simply requesting that we come to an agreement regarding the lost pants, and that I did not want to make a scene or a big deal out of it. Mistakes happen - it sucks - but lets just agree to agree and we never have to see each other again I told her. Well - she disagreed. The owner proceeded to yell that it was my fault and to look at my house and that she doesn't ever make mistakes. I sat there arguing with her for 15 minutes, that I just wanted to be compensated for the lost pants, and she proceeded to keep on yelling that it was not her fault.  I felt like I was more than reasonable, telling her I understood mistakes happen and just wanted to agree to agree on something, but she continued to deny any responsibility pointing the finger at me that I brought in the wrong pants. She refused to do anything until she spoke with her son, so after coming back a second time to talk to him they agreed to give me $100, but I am going to have to pay triple that to replace the lost pants. Even as the check was being written she was still yelling at me - and I wasn't even saying anything. Just flat our horrible customer service to a customer that was more than understanding about a mistake and willing to walk away silently if it had been handled a bit differently.",-1
"358",2,"I hate to write a bad review for any business, but I went to this nail salon based on good reviews and had a pretty bad experience. I got there right when they opened on a Sunday and there was already a line of four people, which I thought was a good sign that they must be good. And four more people came in behind me. They were understaffed so they called in backup. When another staff member got there, she told me she was there to assist me. She then told me it was supposed to be her day off. I felt bad, but honestly there's nothing I could do about that. She seemed fairly nice, but absolutely rushed through my gel manicure. She ""couldn't find"" the color I wanted either and instead just picked a color that was supposedly close (it wasn't close). I've never had such a fast manicure. Took maybe 25 minutes. The shapes of my nails were all over the place and uneven. She left rough edges on them too. She painted dust into two of my nails, there was a bubble in another, and did such a poor job on the edges that they were peeling up over my cuticles. By the evening two nails had already chipped. Maybe because she was rushing and didn't have me keep them under the UV light for the full time. Overall the quality is honestly the worst I've ever had in a manicure. And I'm not that picky. Definitely not worth $30 + tip. I feel bad that she had to come in on her day off, but because of the quality of work I won't be coming back.",-1

I visited Caf├® Rouge with my child, simply because we were passing by. I wasn't blown away by the menu, so I figured it was impossible to mess up a burger. I decided to try the Magic Burger, as the menu is so poorly drafted, it was the only burger I could readily identify. First off, the burger was not presented as it was in the menu. The menu says it's served with pepper-jack cheese and an onion ring, neither of which could be found on the burger. The burger desperately needed the help of pepper-jack though, as it lacked ANY resemblance of taste. There was an obvious absence of seasoning, which was very unfortunate because the burger actually LOOKED delicious. Not even the bacon was able to help the spice deficient burger. The best part of my meal was actually the bread the burger was served on. I didn't even enjoy my Diet Coke, because I assume it was the ice that was giving the beverage a strange after taste.  In the end, the burger lived up to the team it's named after...who also managed a very lackluster SEASON.
Oh, and these items are GROSSLY overpriced considering McDonald's burger patties are better seasoned.",-1
"360",1,"They went with a Chinese theme and menu for New Year's Eve and I really wish they didn't. Not only is it overpriced for Asian food but they did a poor job. I came here after being upset with another restaurant for changing their regular menu for nye. 

I ordered: 
Green tea soba noodle - it had veggies, cucumbers, peppers, and a lot of oil. Massive amounts of oil. The soba noodles weren't even separated; there were huge chucks on the bottom and some couldn't even be broken apart. 
Stir fried tofu - I'm assuming it was soaked in wine. It came with bok choi and  white rice. The tofu had sesame seeds on it and it as a slice. Just one slice. For the price I paid it is not worth it. They jacked up the prices which I'm totally fine with but only if the food was good.",-1

"363",2,"I always like to try new things. This is why I was shocked when I looked at the entire menu and didn't see anything I would want to order. Everything, including the hamburgers, chicken fried steak, etc. was served on a donut. I knew over half the menu would have donuts on it and thought it would be fun to get one for dessert, but they are not joking here. It's truly a donut bar. Confused, I looked around and saw one couple at the bar eating the fried ribs from the app menu. And no one else was really eating. It was a learning experience for me. I sort of understood how a person with anorexia could look at a menu and not only be sort of repulsed but also warily tallying up all the calories involved in the upcoming culinary adventure. And I have never in my life done this! I have to give them credit for doing something I've never seen done before. For that I really applaud them.",-1

Oh HAY there. So, luckily in this metropolis of Portland, we seem to have an appreciation for Thai food. Or maybe it's just food. ANYWAY. This is not the place to get your Thai-fix on. I've tried it three times and third times wasn't a charm, it was....end of the road, my friends. 

Salad rolls, wtf? What was this in my mouth? It was a melody of bland horror and not-quite-ripe veggies. That's ok, it's just an appetizer. But - Pad Thai? You..can't make good pad thai? (Cliche statement coming forth...3....2.....1....) EPIC FAIL. I did not enjoy this pad thai at all. No spice, no flavor, just noodles faking my favorite Thai dish ever. 

So then I tried my second fav - Yellow Curry. NO. FAIL AGAIN.

"367",1,"The manager of this location so obviously doesn't know how to treat his clients. 
First off, it was the FIFA World Cup. Guess what, you will need more staff than usual. Your frustration with the lack of staff shouldn't be reflected on your employees. The servers were great, but their manager -- not at all.
Secondly, because of the lack of staff, there was a long queue with people waiting WHILE the world cup has already started. There were plenty of tables available, but not enough staff to take care of everything. When our turn to be seated finally came and the hostess/waitress was ready to take us to our table, the manager abruptly interrupted her, completely ignoring the fact that she was taking care of her clients. He didn't even apologize.
Thirdly, there was no sound from the TVs outside. Dude, get a grip, it is the world cup. You should have done something about it beforehand. Our poor waiter was doing everything he could to help with the issue. But with a manager like that, nobody can really help.
Fourthly, the tables outside were not put in a position where you could watch the TV. I moved my chair to be able to watch, and again, the manager, without any apologies whatsoever, passed by my chair almost pushing me off it.
The food was all right. The atmosphere outside resembled a dingy old bar. 
The only good thing from that place was the long haired waiter who was polite and nice.

"368",2,"The premise and location were both desirable. It can be pretty difficult to find healthy fast serve meals Downtown. 

There were just a number of issues. First time I walk in midday and most of the chairs were up on the tables for cleaning. I had to ask if they were even open. The chairs remained that way during my entire visit. Later I watched customers take chairs down to sit. Staff did not seem to care.

The space is fairly dated and could use a remodeling. The poor choice of 80s music did not help.

I ordered the half and half which comes with angus beef and chicken. Likely the most overcooked beef I have ever had. The chicken was better but also overcooked. I did appreciate that you can order a ""base"" of all veggies. Sadly, the veggies were mostly onions.

The sauce bar was nice. Two hot sauces and a ""magic sauce"" (which is simply teriyaki).

Service is so incredibly slow and the food isn't anything creative or even done well.  When the spinach and artichoke dip came out my first instinct was, ""wow, that looks like cold dog food in a bowl."" It honestly looked like it had been sitting under the lamp for the past 15 minutes. You know that sad mac n cheese in the hot case at Fred Meyers around 8 pm that's reduced for quick sale?? Yup, this looked just like that.

I also ordered the corn chowder which I've had before and this time it had a weird sour flavor to it.  The oyster crackers were the best part!

"375",2,"I like Uno's lunch specials and the food usually comes quickly.  What is the huge problem with this location is the consistency of the service.  There are some bright spots -- some good people who get the order right and actually check on the table.  More often, there appears to be outright confusion over who has what table, no means to alert a server someone has been seated in their section and apparent black holes where servers go.  Whenever you need something you need to speak up, wave, grab somebody -- anybody.  Don't think eye contact alone will get you anywhere.

Also, there is this tendency to be at either extreme with the bill.  Either it is dropped in the middle of the meal. No coffee or desserts are to be ordered I guess.  Why not just leave the left over boxes with the meal when you bring it.  The other extreme has you wanting to wander through the place to locate someone to take your money.",-1

The service is usually pretty bad.  You might have to wait to find someone to take your order and regardless of what time of day you're there, you will definitely be waiting for a while to get your order.  
(My favorite thing to do is stand at the end of the counter, in front of the machine they use to track orders.  After 3 minutes your order turns red and flashes. It probably won't keep you entertained for the next 3 minutes, though.)

My experience with the food has been totally hit or miss.  I tried a teriyaki wrap and found it barely edible.  I'd recommend staying away from the wraps involving brown rice--super crunchy.  On the other hand, I had the portabello sandwich the other day and it was pretty good.

I know this place is supposed to be ""healthy"", but I would really like *some* slightly junk-food toppings on the frozen yogurt.  They have fruit (yum!), yogurt covered raisins (ick-I don't want yogurt ON my yogurt), and granola (meh).  Would some dark-chocolate chips kill them?

Fine, 15 minutes later 3 young women came in wanting to order carry out because they were in a hurry..... the host guy told them he would find them a seat so they would not have to wait and completely sat them down in front of myself and everyone that was waiting and slightly had a attitude when I brought it to his attention how disrespectful that was.

The drinking glasses smelled of putrid eggs, the food on the buffet was luke warm at best, and there were no labels on the food until half way through when she wrote them by hand.

Boston's Chowder served over Buttermilk Biscuit $5.25,  lb of Chilled Maine Lobster Salad Sandwich $12.95, Broiled Chicken Breast Fillet with a Ritz Cracker Topping  $10.25, and Fried Onion Nuggets and Fettuccini Alfredo as side items. 

With the submission of money, I was seated and things rolled out pretty smoothly.  In retrospect, I suppose pre-ordering this way keeps the business (especially the kitchen) running smoothly and probably works best for Boston's.  The chowder was thick and gloppy. The flavor was smooth and starchy. And the biscuit only made things doughier. The small bits of clams were on the lesser-than-generous side but at $5.25 the portion size was decent. However, the bowl that it came in bothered me a bit- it was fire engine red and reminded me that other restaurants use these types of bowls for their salad dressings on buffet counters. No matter how dishwasher-friendly a bowl may be, I think presentation is an important part of the dining experience. I wasn't expecting fancy, but c'mon...

The Lobster Salad Sandwich was creamy, smooth and packed with lobster chunks. I especially liked the toasted sliced bread folded in half- it gave more attention to the lobster meat that my mouth deserved. The sandwich worked well in a formulaic way of tastefulology: mayo creaminess + soft meatiness + crispy oily-toastyness = busy mouth.

The Broiled Chicken was quite good. A light Ritz Cracker topping played well with the chicken.  Apparently, this topping is what Boston's is famous for. Simplicity was the name of the game for this dish and it definitely threw it out of the ballpark. 

The sides were... well, sides. Nothing really memorable. The Fettuccini Alfredo was something you'd expect from a Fish House rather than an authentic Italian joint. Using the core of an onion as a fried nugget made for a soft, nuttier taste. But they didn't end up in my doggy bag.

IN A NUT SHELL: With the rising cost of seafood, this joint still sustains semi-reasonable price points. The portion sizes are not over-the-top, but will satiate you. Service is pleasant and non-intrusive (exhibit A: Diane, our waitress).  Presentation of the food would really help this place, but I think their focus is on getting the food out just they want it rather than all the frills and hoops that some other restaurants make you go through.",-1
"391",2,"My house cleaner was Sabrina P. She was exactly on time which I appreciated. And she had sent me a text message telling me how excited she was to meet me. Sabrina herself was very friendly and courteous.

 What I didn't appreciate was that she spent the entire 3 hours that I had paid for cleaning my bathrooms. 

I have one full bathroom, one half bath and one bathroom with just the toilet and sink essentials. I figured three hours to clean my house would be sufficient but apparently not! Apparently, I would need to pay something like 6 hours for this woman to do my whole house. She had spent two of my three hours cleaning the full bath and then hastily cleaned the other two. I appreciate how clean the first bathroom is but the other two only had a mediocre job and her excuse was that ""she pays attention to the details."" But apparently only for the first bathroom because the other two were not cleaned with the same attention.

Although Sabrina was very nice, next time I go to book a house cleaner I will go to someone who cleans my place in a timely manner for a much better price.",-1
"392",2,"Not bad. Pretty tasty, fast and hot. I would have given a star extra, but they got rid of the sat├® sauce! Not cool! The sizes are small for the price you pay (another star missed) plus the staff isn't very friendly, making it two stars from me.",-1
"393",2,"Fusion Bistro indeed.  Much like most of Ohio's asian food experiences I've had to date, it's a mostly dark wood toned Chinese styled restaurant, but with a variety of asian foods on the menu.  For example, one could find stir fried string beans on the menu sitting right next to their selection of sushi - a bit of an odd combo, but it seems to work in Ohio!

Although the decor was pleasant enough and the staff was about on par with what you might expect, the food was a bit lacking.  With perhaps a few exceptions, most of the stir fried dishes seemed to taste of the same oyster sauce and vegetable oil mixture despite what the menu might imply.  

Their sushi on the other hand was passable.  Once again, I give this place one bonus star just for having a few items that tasted interesting and for having sushi that didn't taste completely frozen / thawed in the middle of Ohio.",-1
"394",1,"If you want bad service, this is the place to go.  They do a great job selling and a miserable job in the service area.   I've bought a Porsche, an Audi and a Ford from Chambers and have had great luck. I bought two Mercedes from Chambers and incurred the worst experience with one of them that could ever be possible.  The  service and ethics in Somerville is far below Mercedes standards.  Recent yelp reviews confirm what type of service you will receive in Somerville.",-1
"395",2,"This place was not what I was expecting, but I still had a fun time while here.  The bar is dark inside.  Everything is painted black and the blinds were all closed on the windows.  Not my type of atmosphere, as I love the sunlight.  The interior needs some updating.  The leather bar stools are all torn apart and the rest of the furniture scattered about just seems very old and a little dirty.

They have two pool tables that are free to play, so that was fun entertainment.  Their craft beer selection is great, however.  There are options on draft and in the bottle.  We had a $5 for $15 deal from Orlando Weekly which got us three craft beers.  Great deal whenever you can get it.

I'm not sure if I would go back on my own, but wouldn't say no if a group of friends wanted to go there.",-1
"396",1,"I attended a conference here and decided to eat the breakfast buffet and wish I had'nt.  The food was barely warm and the quality made me yearn for waffle house , Denny's, and ihop or huddle house........unfortunately the cost was ridiculously expensive, roughly 5 times what a good breakfast should cost.  Ultimately, it was the most expensive breakfast I walked away hungry from......which is maddening.  I went on to attend the conference which was catered by the hotel and the choice was between anorexic chickens or IBS pulled pork which looked like leftovers from last weeks catering.  Disappointing and hungry to say the least.",-1
"397",2,"Brought the kids here for Dosa's.  It started off with an I love Indian food.
Mommy doesn't.  I suggested we go for a walk and try the House of Dosa and have dinner there.
What's a Dosa?  They asked.  And if you must ask, then you should continue to read on those others who have reviewed here before.

The kids never having tried a Dosa were curious and shocked as to how big it was.  Actually it's not that much, just that the oversized crepe looks impressive at first sight.  
There are so many varieties that they decided to try the basic.  One had chicken, the other had beef. and we all tried the chicken 67 or 57 or 78?  Doh! I can't remember!
And we had the pakora's which I quite like here.

As for the Dosa, I just thought it was meh today.  And my Lassi was a bit too salty.  The kids loved the Mango shakes.

Unfortunately it didn't impress them as much as I'd hoped.  They're more on the kick of a butter chicken which I keep telling them that it's not really Indian food.  It's like us eating sweet and sour pork and fortune cookies.

Not that I'm complaining, but that on this evening, it was just meh.
Yes meh.  not Yay!

Maybe I've been over dosa'd?

I did get to give them a lesson on what is Cricket!
And so their food education continues!",-1
"398",2,"Very disappointing food and service. Dinner took over three hours and not because we were leisurely. Although we were seated immediately (had a reservation for eight), it took a ridiculously long time to get our drink orders in, and then have them served.  The food was lacking on flavor. I had the albacore tuba, pan grilled. I expected a crust, but received it slightly browned and devoid any seasoning. The faro seemed undercooked and again lacking seasoning. However, the seafood tower looked good in other tables, so perhaps I just ordered poorly. Others at our table ate their meals, but none left talking about the quality. Will not go back.",-1
"399",1,"Oh, Ma Soba... I wanted to love you.
It started out so good when we noticed you had $4 draft beer. This should be instant love... until we figured out why it was so cheap. Small mugs. Dirty taps. Being handed the wrong beer.

We chalked it up to a mistake and thought that maybe the edamame will be better. It's hard to mess up edamame.
Except they did.
My guess? Frozen edamame... and clearly microwaved. The soy beans were squishy and slimy, not crisp and salty. It was really disappointing.

Maybe the food will be better? Not so much.
Somehow, despite being smoothered in soy sauce, the yaki soba was amazingly bland. We decided the sauce must taste like the tears of a thousand dead Asian relatives... but not in an awesome, magical way... but in a sad, you've lost your honor kind of way.

Oh yeah, our waitress had issues, too. 
I get it. I have huge feet. I deal with it. But geez... our waitress managed to step on my feet every time she came to our table. EVERY TIME. My feet were always under the table. I'm not sure what was going on, but I was tired of being stepped on.

"400",2,"This is my 2nd stay at this hotel. ( & last). We checked in and the first room was incorrect, 2nd was filthy and kept the 3rd room. The building was fine, there is an issue that needs to be addressed with housekeeping. When we got a room that appeared tidy it was missing appropriate linens. The breakfast was mediocre at best. The coffee wasn't good, and many things were empty. This hotel could be fine with some effort. Bummer it's in a convenient location.",-1

At  time, the manager brought over the chef, who told my husband (previously a chef in SF) that the raw chicken he sent back was cooked to 165 degrees - when my husband asked if he would eat the raw chicken, he said he would. The guy is cracked - if you want to be sick, go ahead and eat. In my mind, the chef is not a chef, but poser wannabe. Until the menu changes or an article comes out that the chef is gone, I won't be back. Sadly, it WAS a great go to.",-1
"402",2,"First things first, I spent over 20$ on their pastries earlier this month and found a piece of plastic in one of the chocolate pastries, I sent them an email---no response. I mentioned having a picture, but their website online did not allow me to attach anything to the email.
Before the plastic incident, I tried the black cherry cake which was so-so..If I didn't know there was some cherry jam in it, I am not sure I'd have guessed. My husband had a chocolate Opera and was not impressed either,it was not even chocolatey,tasted more like a vanilla cream.
Anyway, I am giving 2 stars to be fair, they are for the sweet cheese pirozhok which was great! I may return for it.
I did not eat the rest of the pastries cause I did not know what else I might find in them...

I asked the manger this time to check my future flights because I purchase their Even More product for future flight. The desk attendant acted miffed and said ""it's not like I can stamp your future ticket."" The manager assured it should be on future flights. The desk attendant silenced.

"408",2,"The cinema suites at AMC are very nice. Very comfortable leather recliners which make you feel like you are watching a movie in the comfort of your own home. The reason I gave it a low score is due to the poor service and bland sub par food. Not to mention the price. $5.00 for a soda and we were never even given refills. I was paying with a credit card and I gave it to the waitress. She returned with my bill again and walked away. There was no credit card in there. I put on my light and 20 minutes later she still hadn't returned. Finally the movie ended and I had to track her down to get my credit card back. She claimed I never gave her my credit card but wasn't too concerned that it was now lost. The assistant manager was trying to find it. Eventually someone turned it in and they proceeded to charge me for the bill and argued with me and make me feel like I was the one in the wrong. I was so frustrated by the time I left that I told them I wouldn't be back. I would go back but only to watch a movie. Never again will I do the dine in.

"409",1,"I wish I checked reviews before booking this Hotel. They kicked us out with two small kids in the middle of the night without any options to stay. Parking is payable (for the prices they charge and headache they gave us it should be free with free car washes).
My family and I arrived at midnight, I emailed them in advance that we are coming late and will spend all day traveling. To my surprise, when we came hotel receptionist told us that the room we booked was given away to someone else. The card on file was declined and without giving it a thought they assumed that a family with two kids, arriving at midnight, shouldn't be notified. It is their policy not to call you if anything is wrong with your reservation. First of all, in the state were we live and ALL other places we stayed before, you pay for the room when you check out not before you arrive!!!! Or at least at the moment when you check-in. To my shock and frustration, they added a horrific customer service. the shift manager was treating me like I am stupid and asked if I understand English and what else he has to explain to me so I understand and leave.

"411",2,"My husband and I have had good experiences at Hudson Grill before (even at this location in Midtown), but this was not one of them.  Granted, we came during 3 big games, which meant there was quite a rush in the kitchen.  Still, it took at 15 minutes for me to receive my Bailey's coffee after ordering.

I ordered Pedro's Delight with cheddar and no bun, and I've had this same exact burger before and loved it, but it didn't sit well with me this time.  The guacamole was very meh.  The fries were nothing special.  I was disappointed, and I don't think I even ate half of my lunch.

The chili tater tots were exactly like what we expected: gooey, messy, and all-American.  I know this is a complete generalization, but if you're a dude there for the game, you'll probably love these.  Next time I'd like to try some of the other appetizers on the menu; there are a lot to choose from.

Our server Nico was very friendly and kind.  The atmosphere was understandably loud and charged for the game.  The restaurant has two levels and lots of tables, so we were sat immediately, which was a great relief after being told Taco Mac across the street had a wait of 45 minutes.  And, all considering, the wait for our food was a consequence of the games.  It's just surprising that, considering the price and after having 2 good previous experiences, both my husband and I didn't feel like finishing our burgers.  There just wasn't much good about them.

I didn't get a bill because they did not ask for my email address and clearly created one, a non existent address. The whole experience was incredibly unprofessional.

"418",2,"I have mixed opinions about the apt.

What's good:
It has a nice club house, on-site workout room, pool, and lots of trees. It's very close to Hill Elementary (very good elementary school, for those who have kids) and Lowes, Home Depot, Costco, Sam's Club, Randalls, HEB, Target, Walmart, WholeFoods, Sprouts,  ...

What's bad:
Water bill is outrageous. I think it's a shenanigan from the management company.  Water bill is 3-month delayed. I moved out on 12/31/2013, and then in Jan I got the bill for Oct-Dec 2013, which is more than $320 (over $100 per month)!  It's definitely unreasonable for 2 adults and a 6-yo (I always took shower after workout at gym).  Since there is some delay in water bill, the bill for the last couple months was based on estimate, and the management company ""conveniently"" marked up the price.  I was paying $50-$70/month in June-Sept, and obviously summer consumption should be more than winter.  When I asked about this, the manager first told me it's an estimate, but then told me it's actual bill. I know for a fact that the actual bill doesn't arrive until 3 months later, otherwise I would have received the Oct bill before I moved out in Dec.  After I challenged her, she told me it's an ""accurate estimate"". Then when I asked her if there would be any adjustment once the actual bill came out, she said no. So you can see here how the management company makes money easily.

Before I moved out, I hired a professional cleaning company to perform a thorough move-out cleaning.  We only lived there for half a year and we kept everything clean, so it wasn't bad at all to begin with.  The cleaning lady spent 3 hours and did a wonderful job, but the apt management still charged me $105 for cleaning.

The apt is old (built in 1970s), and you'll definitely feel it.  The fans kept clanking, the a/c kept dripping water on the wall, the stove came on and off depending on its mood, ...",-1
"419",1,"My 15 friends and I were super excited to celebrate a weekend away together and decided to have dinner and drinks at the Gnarly Gar on our first night. We rented a great townhouse on the lake within walking distance to the marina and restaurant. Unfortunately some of our friends had to finish their work week before heading here from Dallas. It was late when they arrived but we were all super hungry and ready to get out together and listen to some live music and have some cocktails to celebrate our getaway. 
The Gnarly Gar was super cute on the outside but their staff could learn some hospitable manners. Our table of 16 was approached by a staff member that said ""our kitchen closes at 11.  You don't want to be those people that order 3 minutes before closing, right.""  
I've worked in the service industry for 20 plus years and I've never turned a customer down for food service before my restaurant closed.

"424",1,"I decided to head to Pelons to grab a drink and a snack before the Yeasayer show at Stubbs last week. The bar/patio area filled up quickly bc everyone else had the same fun idea before the show! Pelons was so unprepared that it was obviously they had no clue of the Stubbs schedule. Way to go management! People including myself were waiting 40 + minutes for drinks and even longer for food.  The one waitress in the outdoor bar area was desperately in the weeds, darting around delivering ""sorry's"" to everyone instead of drinks, food, or tabs. I finally ended up canceling my orders and left hungry and thirsty.
When you decide to open up a cool looking joint right across the street from one of the most popular and respected venues in Texas, you should do your research.

Nothing (and no explanations or bread as compensation for the slow kitchen.)  When it finally arrived, the food was okay but definitely not exceptional.

"428",1,"My girlfriend and I moved from Atlanta, GA to Boulder back in August. We chose Solana 3100 because of the amenities and the fact that it was a non-smoking residence. My girlfriend was 3 months pregnant when we moved in so the luxurious amenities and the fact Solana was a ""smoke-free"" residence was very appealing to us. We worked with Rachael Cooper during the leasing process and were told we could rent 2 parking spaces and would be able to cancel our lease for a $600 penalty, if needed (we're expecting an addition to our family in March so we planned to either buy a house or move into a bigger apartment before that time). After a 3 day drive to CO we were informed by Rachael that we couldn't have 2 spaces, but were offered a tandem space instead. This was fine with us, but we were only allowed 1 clicker to open the gate. So everyday one of us would park on the street or in guest parking until the other arrived and then would move the cars into our spot. Brittney, the manager, did eventually accommodate us with a second clicker a few days ago, for our last few weeks in Solona. 

I'm not a construction guru, but it seems like the place was built quickly to get people in as quick as possible and has several issues. Don't get me wrong, the place is gorgeous, but you pay enough for it to be gorgeous and properly built.  Our first week in, my girlfriend woke up to fiberglass bits in our bed coming from the vent. She had a rash down her leg and we eventually noticed that each of our vents had chunks of fiberglass stuck in them. A few days later construction was working on some pipes above my parking space and left all their materials in my space. I woke up to a flat front left tire and had a similar experience with the same issue a month later. Brittney did offer to reimburse me for the tire. The construction team also does not care to be discreet or accommodating to the residents. One day we were in a rush to the ER and construction had the exit ramp for the parking garage blockaded with a cement truck. Instead of moving up and letting us out they waited until they were finished pouring.

My girlfriend has occasional back pains that come with her pregnancy. Some days it can be painful for her to walk and the elevator is consistently down in our building (2-3 days a week). This isn't a huge ordeal considering we're not on the top floor, but just another inconvenience to note. 

The ""smoke-free"" residence turned out to be a advertising ploy. Not exaggerating, our place smells like weed 4 days a week. I'm all for legalization, but I have a pregnant girlfriend in the home and do not care to expose her to the smoke/smell. After a couple months of complaining we decided it was best for us to cancel our lease and move-out. That $600 cancellation fee that Rachael told us about was off by a solid $3,000.00. It's going to cost us $3,600 to move out of a place that promised us the luxuries and conveniences, but delivered us none of the above.

Finally, before we move out we are hit with the temperature falling below freezing and a heater that can not get our place above 60.  This is the first week we've had to use our heater so I assume this was just another construction short-cut. We've been sleeping fully clothed in thermals the past couple of nights waiting for an HVAC technician.

"431",1,"Well that was a first: The first time I've ever walked out of a restaurant after getting poor or nonexistent service. Totally unexpected from a restaurant I frequent a few times a year with visitors. I even used to buy restaurant gift certificates for my employees here. And I'm actually not a Service Diva! 

It all started when we walked in at about 7:48pm to a restaurant that is less than half full (they close at 10:00pm). The host walks up to us and, well, maybe he was just having a bad day or maybe this was just one big misunderstanding. 

We ask for a table for 3. He says a statement like ""Just to let you know, we also have full service at our bar."" Apparently none of us knew that was a question. His inflection made it seem like it was an option and if that was something we wanted we could speak up now (at a restaurant with plenty of seating). Was he trying to steer our party to sit at the bar in a restaurant that has plenty of seating available? Anyway.. 

We stand there in a silent stalemate for about 10 seconds. He then peers down at us and projected an irritated facial expression and emphatic condescending tone ""So would you like to sit at the bar?""

Wow I've seen that face and heard that tone of voice before!! It's how my dad's girlfriend talks to anyone when she is short on her pain meds. Such a pleasure!

I respond ""uhhhh no"". So he picks up some menus and walks over to a table and we were seated.

At this point I thought it was over. Then, we waited a little over 10 minutes without water. We did get an acknowledgement from a different waitress who didn't say anything like ""Sorry for the wait"" or ""let me flag down your server"" it was more like ""SoandSo will be serving you but what would you like to drink?"". We ordered a bottle of wine. 5 minutes later, no drinks, still no water, and SoandSo was not giving us any time. I think we left at about 8:05pm and walked to a different restaurant.

We were probably the youngest patrons there. Was that an issue? Did they assume we wouldn't have a big enough ticket? Apparently they don't know how much we eat and drink, despite our physiques. 

Were they short staffed? It didn't seem so. One of the servers was in a pretty engaged conversation with another party for about 5 minutes of our wait and our annoyed host was yakking it up with people in the back.

I still wonder with the host -- is there something we did to him? 

I'm going to miss their amazing caesar salad, the brunch vibe, the corn bread 'n butter, the drinks (those Peach Bellinis after a hot walk mmm!), the eclectic unique southern menu with a twist, but I won't be going back there again for personal or professional events.",-1
"432",1,"I was lied to about more than one thing on my first and only visit in April. A simple oil change and state inspection with a scheduled appointment is apparently too much for the lazy techs to handle. I wasn't even waiting for my car - I left it for hours.

I was lied to about there being a check engine light on and a code being thrown, and then they claimed they cleared it (without telling me what the code was or calling me) therefore they couldn't do the inspection, nor could I try to remedy whatever was ""wrong"" with my car. My 4 year old car had no check engine light or warning light of any kind when I left it (and drove it there from South Austin) and no code or light ever came on after that (it's been over 3 months now). To top it off, while I was still in their parking lot, OnStar got a clean read off my car and told me no code had been thrown that day. I was also told they drove my car around for a while to see if the light would come back on, but not even ONE mile was added to my odometer. When I told the manager this, he had nothing to say other than the tech ""exaggerated"" how far he'd driven, and wasn't the least bit apologetic. He didn't charge me for the inspection like he should have, so he obviously knew it was a lie. And he made it out like he was doing ME a favor. To top it off, they couldn't even do something as simple as fill the tires with air and reset the oil life percentage.

My first sign to turn and leave should have been when I was dropping the car off, and when I told the service advisor that the tire quote was too expensive and I couldn't afford it right now, his response was ""of course you can't"".

However I've been in recently at least five times looking for a certain salad dressing. Out of 5 times I've found it twice but usually it's out of stock. This may or may not be their fault as vendors often have there own problems with stocking things. My problem with food fight was the last time I'd gone in to see about the salad dressing they were out yet again and the owner remembered me and let me know they were still out but she didn't seem to know when it was order or if was even ordered. Basically she not only had no idea what the deal was and more importantly was basically like 'I don't know what to tell ya'  I mean I don't expect much in the way of customer service but if you remember someone coming in several times without finding what they want I feel like she should have at least maybe takin my number and maybe let me know when someone else that might have an idea of what is going on at the store to call me or something?! I dunno it's just lame to be like 'to bad, don't know what to tell ya.""

"438",2,"As a noob boulder-er (Level B - 2), this place was kind of small compared to The Circuit in NE, so it didn't take a very long time to try all of the easier routes. If you're a newbie, go to the NE one instead!",-1
"439",2,"This place is huge. And the lines are long. Don't worry after a few months, the place will be empty. Too bad. The decor looks modern and spiffy, and I love the space. 

Speaking of long lines, that is one problem of this place. When I arrived, the line was through the door. Yet the restaurant looked empty. They weren't doing a good job processing the orders fast enough. It looks like they're using the Taqueria Del Sol's approach to ordering. It felt like I was getting into some exclusive night club in LA. 

After waiting in line for a bit, you finally get to order. I ordered the Guacamotle. They tell me if it's okay if the burger is cooked medium well. I should've said, ""NO! medium rare!"" Oh well. I got sweet potato fries as my side. 

They give you these buzzer pagers to get your order. But the servers bring the food to you. What's the point? They should just give us a card with a big number on it so the servers can see it. The servers were confused and mixed up our orders. 

So how was my burger? It was Meh. It reminded me of a 5 Guys Burger. And no, that's not a good thing. They overcooked my meat to hell. It looked and tasted like a tough, flavorless hockey puck. They didn't cook it to medium well, they cooked it well done. They probably mashed the juices out too.

Putting guacamole and aioli sauce on my burger doesn't make the meat any juicier or tastier. If the meat isn't cooked correctly, it ruins the entire burger--no matter how much junk you put in the burger itself. 

My burger, fries and drink cost about $11. That's getting to premium burger territory where I can go to Farm, Yeah!, or Flip and get a better burger. 

They have a good concept going. And the area needs a good burger place. Too bad Grub Bar Bar doesn't provide that. I suggest asking costumers what temp to cook the burgers. Sure it might make things complicated for the cooks, but that's their job. Also, I suggest adding a 3rd cashier to move the line faster.",-1

First I came for convenience sake, and found the shop to be great. Friendly owner, many instruments and all services, and an adorable dog:) but after a while I stopped coming. For a few good reasons:
He tries to sell you everything, even though you're only there for 5 min. I have tried so many violins there but I only went for simple services. What he does is leave you in a room trying stuff that you have no intentions of buying, and go deal with other customers.
He does not handle your instrument with care. I got my sound post adjusted and warned him about my violin's thin varnish, but he still jammed his tools in without paying attention. Once I left it there for varnish touch ups and I am sure he didn't see most of the scratched before giving it back to me. 
Not willing to negotiate prices on instruments for sale
Pros: great adjustment of sound and convenient!

 However i still do not suggest rouge as a place to go if you are fair skinned and are looking for a natural look. 50 dollars to get your makeup applied when the girl doesnt even listen to what you really want is unfair. It seems like alot of the people on here have had a good experience however i dont know what type of makeup they wear. Most people that go to get their makeup done want to look very done up. otherwise why not just do it at home. I guess if u are doing wedding makeup (although id really like to see an example of nautural makeup done for a wedding...maybe you guys could post some pics on your websites of a few different skin types.) then its an ok place to go. ALL i was saying is when i ask for no foundation and just coverup on any redness and undereye circles and just blush and mascara...DONT insist and then without my permission draw on pinup like eyebrows and a cateye as thick as my pinky finger. I just felt like i had no say in what i wanted and for 50 dollars i should be able to get whatever i want. Maybe the girl who did my makeup doesnt work there anymore as it seems the owners take their trade very seriously. In no way was i saying anyone was mean or unproffesional but being in the nursing field i know that the patient/customer is always right so if i am paying for you to do my makeup and u have every color and everytype of palate to work with why not take the time to make sure your customers are happy. I was completley rushed through my appointment. i am a very nice patient person but i left there soooo dissapointed in a place that had me sooo excited to go to.Its very pretty and clean in there.

The food (I got a nameless chicken dish) was completely uninspired; in fact, I prefer the stuff from the food trucks. I would go so far as to say that the pad thai was disgusting.

The letter stated that if I missed 3 appointments in a 12 month rolling period ""for reasons that we do not find acceptable"" I will no longer be permitted to receive care from any TCV location. I'm going to tell a couple things: It is not MY privilege to be your customer, it is your privilege to have ME as a customer. Your customers can choose to be with a company that values their business, you however can not exist without customers. Secondly, who are you to determine what is an acceptable reason for missing an appointment? Have you elected a ""Missed appointenet czar"" who will determine my fate based on their arbitrary judgement? Why I missed an appointment in frankly none of your business. I and I alone will determine whether I have something more important or not. Your arrogance in this statement only highlights your obtuse regard for customer service.

"457",1,"Let me begin with a few comments.

First, the positive reviews on Yelp is what drove me to contact ProTect.  Second, I'm a reasonable person who does not just look for nits to give someone the poorest (1-star) rating.

However... 

DO NOT call these people if you are looking for a combination of new work plus touch ups around your home.  We are in the middle of a small remodel replacing the majority of our tile floors, countertops, backsplashes, etc. throughout our 3000 square foot home.  We will end up with new baseboards, door casings, cabinet trim, some drywall repair, and misc touchups throughout our home.  This was right-up ProTect's alley when i asked during the phone call to schedule an estimate...

However...

I was told that ""... we do not feel that your project is a good fit for our team..."", which was a polite way of saying thanks for taking the time out of your work day to meet with us, show us around, and then let us decide we are not interested in your project.

I pointed out a small area (a few dime sized spots) on our ceiling (simple white paint) that needed to be touched up, i was told that they would recommend painting our entire ceiling some 1000+ square feet.  I said that was ridiculous.  I would be happy with a simple touch-up and I understand it may not match 100% with rest of the ceiling, but i was okay with that risk for something the size of a few dimes (plus or minus).

""I understand that you are ok with touch-ups, however, we must stick to our standard of painting corner to corner on every surface we touch.  This would include the banister, walls that we would patch, etc...""

Bottom line, if you are going to use ProTect, expect to have to paint more than you may need.  If they tell you otherwise, it could be that i just had someone who didn't want my business.  But if that is the case, don't waste my time scheduling an estimate call.

Note: several other painting companies provided estimates and had NO ISSUE with the touch-up... in fact, they all recommended touch-up and not full re-paint.  I think this was Pro-Tect's way to possibly justify charging much more for more work than was really needed.

I hope my experience saves others from being taken advantage by ProTect.",-1
"458",1,"So now I have been to iPic Theater. And never need to go back.

Having been once I can now say, with the authority borne of hundreds of Austin movie theater tickets under my belt, that there is just no reason to go. $16.   SIXTEEN.  $5.50 more than Alamo and $4 more than Flix or Moviehouse for a non-premium seat up front, disingenuously labeled ""Premium,"" nearer the screen than I would ordinarily sit.  These (admittedly comfortable, large, non-reclining leather chairs with seat trays) are distinguished from the ""Premium Plus"" seats further back which do recline and are priced at $28 (!!) but include at seat service and a blanket, needed by no one with normal circulation in Austin this century)  

So I got to pay a premium to sit in the first 2 rows with no at-seat service. For someone who might ordinarily have a couple of beers during a movie, this meant I either had to make do with one or get up and walk to the lobby to buy another, missing part of the film.  I settled for one purchased at the lobby bar, and a decent (but overpriced) sandwich.  I paid $14 for a Turkey Panini that was toasted but not warmed all the way through and $8.50 for a 22oz Adelbert's ale. 

I was seated next to a stupid talking lady who I had to shush. And who I also had to tell to put her phone away during the movie, during which I saw not a single usher anywhere near the steerage seats.

After a tiring session of kayaking at Deep Cove, we stopped by at the Turtle coffeehouse for a quick snack. I ordered a slice of pizza, a latte, and a chicken samosa which the owner/cashier promised to be excellent. He even said he wouldn't charge anything if I dislike it. For the record, when someone says this, 95% of the time, the food usually sucks.

Well, let's see. The latte was mostly foam and the pizza looked like the ones from Granville Street. The samosa was definitely a big FAIL--lukewarm on the inside with very little chicken and very doughy and dry on the outside. Overall, it didn't taste fresh. I don't even want to guess how long the samosas were sitting in the display case. Worst samosa ever! Expect some wait if it's a bit crowded because there was pretty much one person manning the entire cafe--and that was on a weekend.

"463",2,"First of all, the car is great, the price was ok, and our salesman Carl was very good.

Now for the bad - this place is very disorganized (to the customer's eye) and they kept us waiting for an eternity as they processed our deal, even after we had agreed on terms.

Our car wasn't going to be ready until the next day (they had to pick it up at the O.K. North dealership and then prep it), so they gave us a loaner and we left our old license plate with them, as they were going to deliver the new car to us (up near Daytona, so that was nice too).

The next day, Carl came with the new car, and had my wife sign all the paperwork (she was buying it, not me), but the car had a temp plate on it.

Carl said he didn't remember getting the plate from me, but they would look for it.

When I looked over the paperwork that evening I found that they had added a $3,000 ""platinum"" service contract without specifically asking my wife if she wanted it - she didn't even know she had bought it.

A couple of days later, my wife got a call from Carl saying the financing wasn't approved and we would have to find alternate financing or they would take the car back.  Who does that?  My wife has excellent credit and almost no bills.

She was able to work that out with them, and complained about the service contract so luckily that was removed from the final sale.

This week her temp tag was expiring so we stopped in on our way to Tampa (and from, as it turned out, thanks to their incompetence).  They still hadn't found the tag, and now were saying we never gave it to them.  Since they had sent in the paperwork already, they could not issue us a new temp tag.  

My wife got them to agree to reimburse us for the cost of a new permanent license plate, which she was able to get the next day.

After waiting 30 minutes a waitress finally came outside & acknowledge that we were even there (there were only two other tables that were occupied).  First red flag of many...  Magarita's were watered down, the shrimp tasted spoiled (sent it back, which was taken off the bill), the dip was mostly cheese, hardly any spinach or artichoke.

Very disappointed in the service and the food.  They have lost us as customers.",-1

"470",1,"We ordered our meal, waited for 45 minutes and got home with an incomplete meal. We found hair in our meal, called the restaurant and were promised a credit. We decided to try again, against my better judgment and spoke to Vicki. She was disrespectful and rude. This is the most horrible experience and I would rather eat from the convenience store than give them business.",-1
"471",1,"I have been debating whether or not to write this review but I believe I must...

I went to Hair Mechanix based off the reviews from Yelp. When I arrived, it was a small 3 chair shop, nothing special but clean and the ladies seemed nice. I had an appointment with Christina for a cut, highlights, and low lights. She was very quiet, didn't say much and when she did she mumbled so it was very hard to understand what she was actually saying. When she started to do the highlights, I thought it was a little odd how she was doing them... i.e. just taking huge chunks of hair and bleaching them, the foils weren't tight to my head and they seemed to be crooked. She maybe put about 10 foils in total... Then when I thought she was going to do the low lights she started to dye the REST of my hair!!!! By the time I realized what had happened it was too late. I have gone all dark before so it wasn't THAT big of a deal but still frustrating. When the dye job was done, she did the cut... also not what I wanted, I asked for just a little framing around my face as I am trying to grow it out and just need something a little more interesting then straight hair. That is not what i got, I more or less got long bangs.... When she was done, the style looked OK all put together. I left thinking that it wasn't bad but not the best....That was until I got home to really look at it....

When I got home and inspected the highlight job I was really frustrated, their was a section right along my part where the bleach had bled out and was white compared to the rest. My right side of my head had almost no highlights and when I pulled my hair back it looked like I had 3 major skunk stripes- one down the center of my head and 2 on either side... I tried to just deal with it but couldn't so I made another appointment to have her fix it. 

When I arrived for her to fix it again, she was still very quiet and just asked if I wanted more highlights, I said no and showed her the issues. The fix job was a disaster as well. The area that had the bleed spot turned white, the extra highlights were crooked. The highlights around my face was orange and when she tried to fix them she didn't leave the dye in long enough to set but said that it wouldn't stay very long and I would need to come back in in a few weeks to have it done again. I dont think so

All in All, I can live with my hair for now but I will be having it completely redone soon SOME WHERE ELSE!!!",-1
"472",2,"Expensive and not too good. The customer service was good, but the food was off in flavor. I had the croque Monsieur. Too heavy and too much going on in the sandwich to enjoy it. Stick to something simple.",-1
"473",1,"Do not drive to this restaurant. The parking lot sheriff will ask you how long you plan on staying in the restaurant. Seriously.....then her words are, ""If it is more than 90 minutes prepare to be towed."" WOW! And her counterpart (big mafia-type man with grey hair and Hitchcock body type) will follow you and make sure you are going into the restaurant.  So, that sets the tone. The floors are sticky, the tables are sticky, and the waitresses are rude. Might be overlooked if the food were good -- or at least, if it didn't make you sick. Food poisoning is not fun. Granted, I tried this place three times, and only got food poisoning on the last try, but I won't be back.",-1
"474",1,"Let me start off by saying this: INFORM YOUR CUSTOMERS OF PRICING TO AVOID ANY MISUNDERSTANDINGS! I go to this place for the first time after my mother had recommended it because she got an oil change for under $35.00. The guy who's going to do the oil change asks me which oil I get ""regular or synthetic"" I said I wasn't sure and that I usually go to Toyota to get my oil change regularly and he said ""then it has to be synthetic because it's a 2010 vehicle"". He never discussed pricing with me. Once he's done some other guy tells me the total is $70.00 which surprised the hell out of me because they never mentioned how much it was prior, otherwise I would've walked out and went back to Toyota. Prior to paying I called Toyota to confirm that I get synthetic oil changes and indeed I did, for $53.00. The guy with a beard not sure if he was the owner was a smart ass implying Toyota were giving discounts or promotions and that he's not Toyota, quite rude if you're an owner. I am never going back to this place again, always tell your customers how much the service is to avoid surprises or have a sign that displays the price as any other regular gas station would. I literary paid an additional $20 to this hole in the wall shop when I could've saved myself that for the same type of oil.",-1

1 star - very friendly front desk staff who literally had a beer in my hand within a minute of walking in. 
2 stars - minimal 10 min wait for walk-in

That's it. That's all I can give. I asked for advice/guidance/ideas on what kind of cut I should get and the hairdresser was at a loss for words. She was either recovering from a bad hangover from the Saturday night before or she just has no imagination whatsoever. I get the impression that it's the latter. This is not the place to go to if you want some help with getting a new style. I finally came up with a suggestion myself and asked her if she could do it and she agreed but then halfway through the cut, she started to change it.  Sigh. Again, my own fault for straying from my regular hairdresser. Never again.",-1
"477",2,"My family and I are currently on vacation in Orlando. We were looking for a hibachi type restaurant in the area and Google pulled up Amura. Looking at their website and their awards we thought that it would be a good place to go and eat but we were wrong. First off, the room they took us to was extremely cold and so we ended up asking for a new seating area. Also, the wait time for the chef was way too long. When it came to them actually cooking our food, the chef barely seasoned the food. All he used was soy sauce and teriyaki sauce. I'm not going to lie, the service there was good, but the food was not up to the standard I expected; especially with the amount of awards that they have. Not a place I would visit again, to be honest.",-1

The place was packed on a Saturday at 2PM, and seating at the bar is first come, first serve, so you literally have to look around with a hawk's eye to see who is leaving. The wait for a table for 2 was about 30 minutes. All in all, it was OK, except for the fact that one woman sat down next to us 5 minutes after us, received and finished her meal BEFORE we even got ours. I don't understand that discrepancy in service because our sandwiches were NOT hard to make........... I don't think this place is worth any type of wait.",-1

"482",1,"This is a terrible apartment complex. Pay $100 more per month and live somewhere decent. The only positive I can think of is that the management and maintenance guy are responsive, timely, and helpful. But it would have been nicer if I never had to deal with them at all.
Problems/issues I have:
poorly fitted front door that stuck worse and worse as the weather warmed up, and a sticky lock. It was ""fixed"" a few times.
No outlet in bathroom (not a malfunction per se, but seriously?)
One room doesn't have a window.
One day gallons of water started leaking from the bathroom ceiling and I had to call emergency maintenance to turn off the hot water. For the next 4-5 days I had a huge hole in the ceiling and many people coming in and out of the apartment to fix it.
My next door neighbor said this happened to her THREE times in a year.
The oven is totally fucked. On its good days, it takes (literally) 3 or 4 minutes of messing with the pilot to get it to light. On its bad days, it doesn't strike at all, rendering the oven itself useless and making a lighter necessary to use the burners on top.
There are other small problems not worth listing, but consider yourself warned.

It was the worst standard room we have experienced so far [i.e. very outdated, the smallest bed (for 2 adults) for a standard room, and very old carpet]. 

My husband, our dogs, and I stayed there for a night (thanks goodness).

We checked in around 1.15 AM. We were so exhausted that day.
Once we opened the room door, the first thing I noticed was the ""tiny"" bed on a quite large and very outdated room.

I went back to the front desk, and asked about it.
I asked why the bed was so small (considering there were two adults).
She said that the standard room came with ONE full size bed.
Hhhmm.. That was the smallest full size bed I have ever seen.
I asked her if we could change to a room with bigger bed and were willing to pay the difference. She said that there was no room available.
We were super tired and decided to stay there.

I usually take a shower after getting to a hotel room.

They have a great selection at this location but I was in the store for 35 mins with 0 acknowledgment from the staff, luckily I knew where items were located so I didn't need much assistance. Then I waited in line behind a lady who was upset at how long she had to wait because the customer in front of her bought something on a promotion and the cashier encouraged her to go grab more. Instead of suspending the transaction and ringing up myself and the other lady we all waited while she shopped and picked up 3 more items. It was not a great judgement call by the cashier and he just brushed off the next customers complaints instead of address them and making the situation better.

If you want a cheap hotel near Universal, you could do worse but you might do better.  The staff was nice.  You can pick up your tickets for Universal if you already booked online.

The wings were big and meaty but biting into them was a bit gross.  The meat was fatty, oily and slightly warm.  The skin was rubbery, the kind that snaps back after you take a bite - I can't even think of ordering chicken wings for awhile.

The nacho's were bizarre.  Nacho chips piled high with Legends own cheese which was like a heavy mayo.  There was chicken on it which was shredded to a paste and pretty gross.  Does Hormel's make chicken spread?  A few uncooked sliced peppers were on top.  We scraped off the cheese and paste with our forks and had a few of the chips, since we were starving and trying to make the best of it before the Bruins game started.

"496",2,"This is the first time I've eaten at Spuds. My wife ate there when she was a kid in the 80's but I've never been. Every time I drive by a Spuds location they always looked closed. There are a few cars in the parking lot but nothing about the outside of the restaurant looks inviting or tells you they are open. It just looks dark and gloomy. 

The inside of the restaurant isn't much better. There aren't very many windows and the decor and style is something straight out of the 80's. I honestly don't think they've updated their restaurants in the last 30 years. The staff are friendly enough but nothing to write home about. 

The food is mediocre at best. I ordered the pot roast and baked potato dinner. The pot roast wasn't homemade, it was a tv dinner warmed up. It was just thin slices of roast beef, the same stuff you get out of a swansons tv dinner. And it was cold. The baked potato was BAD. I mean it was at least 6 hours old. You could tell it had just been sitting in a heating drawer for hours. I cut into it and was extremely hard and dark brown/yellow on the outside, and mushy on the inside. I sent it back and got fries to replace it. The fries were actually decent. 

My wife also had to send her food back. The staff and management were very nice about it and didn't give us a hard time, they kept apologizing over and over again. It turns out this place is named Spuds because of a guy named Spud, it has nothing to do with potatoes but that was pretty obvious when they served me that nasty baked potato.

Well we came buy every day and they have been closed ,finally Saturday  nite we show up at 7:30 pm and they are finally open so we walk up to the window and ask for a sample the guy tells me ""we aren't doing it any more sorry no more samples ."" I ask him how can you not give any samples if you haven't even been open all week and close Sunday he says we just aren't sorry ! First of all why enter the contest and expect to win $10000 first place prize if you turn everyone down or dnt even open at all !

"515",2,"My husband and I went there today for lunch and had an okay experience. 

Pros:
The service and staff were very helpful and friendly. We liked that we could sample items on the menu while we were going through the line on the way to the register so we could see what we wanted to try next time. Great idea!
The decor was very nice; typically restaurants that offer Southern food, the decor is usually too busy and cluttered. I liked that the seating is family style, meaning that you can share a table with other people. I liked that there are rolls of paper towels on the table because fried chicken can get messy. 

Cons:
The fried chicken was only very so-so; the breading on the chicken wasn't spectacular or out of this world. I got 2 pieces, which were both backs, which didn't have a lot of meat on either piece. I wish that they would've been mindful of which pieces were put together; serve one piece that doesn't have a lot of meat with another that does. My husband ordered the 3 piece, which for $2 more per meal, only got him a drumstick along with his other 2 pieces. We spent $20 for both of us for lunch and we had waters with our meal; that's a pricey lunch. 

I got 2 sides: creamed grits and fried okra. The breading on the okra was very good (cornmeal), the grits were okay. My husband got the carrots; they had a nice flavor but were dry. We wished they would've been served with a sauce over them. He also had the mac & cheese, which were just okay, nothing spectacular. 

*Full disclosure* I was raised in the South and had fried chicken every Sunday at my Grandma's house so I am very picky when it comes to chicken. The meal that we had today could be found at any good Southerners house on a Sunday afternoon, after church. It takes something really special for me to sing the praises of someone's friend chicken. This just wan't it. 

We decided against getting dessert but noticed the price on the whole cream pies. The pies were very small and the price was $30 per pie!! These were also cream pies which are easy to make at home. 

I really like 4 Rivers but was disappointed in The Coop.",-1
"516",2,"Meh. The beef sandwich was so flavorless. Tables were missing 1/2 the condiments. The Parmesan cheese jars that were there had no Parmesan. Fries were a big no-horrible. The only redeeming factor was the all beef hotdog. But honestly, I'd rather get an $1.50 hotdog at Costco and save myself some money.",-1
"517",1,"When Sprouts opened in Dunwoody, Georgia, a 20 mile round trip for me, I was intrigued by their colorful weekly fliers in our newspaper but after making the long drives a few times, I was always disappointed. For instance,  the deal on avocados sounded great but in reality, the outsides of every avocado on display was BLUE - and there were only a few available. No, thanks. Also, most fresh produce was set out on tables with no refrigeration so items such as green beans wither and look unappetizing. Bulk items (such as chocolate-covered nuts) were good but they are too high-calorie for us to buy in large quantities. The store was well stocked with canned goods, toiletries, supplements, etc. but I was more interested in fresh produce which just didn't meet my expectations whatsoever. Baked goods did not tempt, nor did the chilled, store assembled meals to go. Lines were long and ""customer service"" even with a recent receipt is not up to the standards of Kroger or Publix. Also, the parking lot at this Sprouts location is so hilly that it is a struggle to keep grocery carts from racing out of control - my car was hit by a runaway cart. Never again.

Some time after the Dunwoody Sprouts store opened, another one popped up on Piedmont Road, much closer to my home, with a parking garage which is very handy in scorching hot Atlanta weather or on rainy days, but unfortunately this store had the identical limp, unappetizing  produce set out on tables. The place was nearly uninhabited: there were a total of two other customers who had absolutely nothing in their shopping carts. On this, my one and only visit, I left empty-handed, very rare for me when grocery shopping.",-1
"518",2,"Not recommended! If you're gonna go, go for the atmosphere. The food was mediocre; not worth the crappy service. Our server was incompetent; she thought we had a party of 5 even though we were one of nine people, she asked us how we wanted our chicken cooked even though it must always be cooked all the way through, and in order to redeem our coupon I had to hand her my phone which she took with her for about 10 minutes and forgot to bring it back. We went on a Sunday night and we were the only ones there but still service was sub-par. Most of the people working were just sitting around and we had to holler at them in order to receive any help. They also seemed very unenthusiastic about helping us or providing good customer service. 
The only redeeming quality about the place, and the reason for the second star, was it's cute look. The set up was nice and the seating was different and unique. 
If you want good Persian- go to Rumi's.",-1
"519",2,"My Fianc├® and I came here last night because we got a gift card for our engagement. 

I started out by having a drink at the bar, as well as the fried zucchini. The bartender was great. His service made this a 2-star review, not a 1 star. 

We moved to the dining area as we wanted to have a nice dinner. In my opinion, the tables are quite small for 2 people. We sat down and were immediately asked what we wanted to drink before even getting a look at the menu. So, we asked for a few minutes. Then, our waiter disappeared. We were looking around (in a practically empty dining room), for at least 10 minutes. Then, a waitress came over to assist us. We were a little confused. Oh, and this was bothersome, they don't offer Happy Hour prices in the dining room, only at the bar. Seriously? Most restaurants extend HH prices to the dining room. 

My Fianc├® got the veal chop which our waitress said was ""Excellent""  ($50...so we were hoping it would be excellent), and I got the summer menu special of the fried zucchini, flank steak, and berries and cream. My guy's veal chop came out and was extremely fatty with no flavor. I was very disappointed in my flank steak, which was very tough, and my steak knife couldn't even cut through it. I could barely chew it and had to swallow it whole. My hand was cramping up trying to cut this thing. And, it was cooked medium. It came with balsamic, mashed potatoes and an ear of corn. I have definitely had better. 

It's sad, but the ""best"" part of this meal was the berries and cream dessert. The berries were fresh as was the whipped cream. Very good. 

Overall, we were very disappointed that our engagement gift was spent on a sub-par meal with so-so service (except for the bartender).  We wouldn't come back here, especially if we had to pay on our own.",-1
"520",2,"We had their fried cactus and the stuffed jalapenos for appetizer. Both of these were fried, and covered in  which i felt was too much bread crumbs. You have to sit at the bar to get the appetizers for happy hour price but the waitress was nice enough to give us the discount anyways.

We ordered steaks which came with dinner rolls, corn bread (shaped as a cactus) and a salad. The dinner rolls came with a garlic spread which was good but the corn bread was cold dry and tasted like it's been sitting out for a long time.

My steak was at least 1/3 fat and didn't enjoy it that much.",-1

"524",1,"Let me start off with, I love PF Changs. I have come here SO many times - I used to be a regular and Ingrid was my favorite server! It's been awhile since my last visit since their prices have gone up quite a bit. Also worth noting that they now have paper/plastic menus, which is kind of strange if you're going to charge $20 an entre. Anyways, when arriving it took the hostess a pretty long time to figure out where to seat us on a Monday night with it being half empty - about 5 minutes. Once we were seated in furthest corner, we noticed there were still bits of rice stuck to the table which was gross but whatever it happens, right? The wait staff, who were all males, proceeded to take 10 minutes ""bro-ing"" around before coming to the table to get our drinks. This process took another 10 minutes to find out they were out of ginger for a the pear margarita, which again, is no issue but after 20 minutes of nothing, time is adding up. After unwrapping the silverware, my guest found a ridiculously long strand of hair - gross, but he was going to try out chopsticks anyway. At this point, it's not going well but I could always count on the food being consistent at a chain like this. I was SO, so wrong. Every, single, dish was cold... Except the spring rolls, which means every dish was waiting around or was pre-cooked before being brought to us, and I don't mean room temperature, I mean it must have been sitting out for at least 10 minutes on a cold plate. The spinach had no garlic, was grossly wilted, and certain parts of it were actually completely inedible. The two chicken dishes were fine, but the lo mein was about 70% cabbage etc. with very few noodles and the meat was extremely overcooked to the point it was excessively chewy. After spending $75 and waiting an uncomfortable amount of time, like over an hour and a half total for an early weekday night, I am officially over this location. I know they've been looking for new hirees for a while, but management needs to seriously reevaluate their current staff.",-1
"525",1,"BUYERS BEWARE!!!
I would give zero stars if possible. We bought a car here back in March. Granted we figured the car would need a few repairs based on the price we paid, we asked Henry why the car was listed at such a low price. He claimed it was for cosmetic reasons (the right passenger door was munched). We asked if he had looked the car over and if there were any existing issues. He claimed it was in perfect condition. So we moved forward in purchasing. Should have been suspicious of the number of times both he and his wife emphasized that all sales are final and car is sold as is, but we foolishly trusted them. 
Driving off the lot, I went to roll down the driver's window. Didn't work. Aggravating, but maybe I should have checked it during the test drive.
Flo told us she would take the transfer papers to the DMV the following Monday, and we should expect the title in the mail within the week. Two weeks go by, no title. So we called, and guess what? She conveniently was JUST heading to the DMV, TWO WEEKS after she said she would (we even paid extra to have her do it instead of us). Frustrating. 
About a month later, temperatures start to warm up, so I turned on the A/C. It blows hot air. Took it to my mechanic, and he says the compressor is shot. Brilliant. Couple weeks later, there's a rattling noise coming from the front right wheel area. Took it back to the mechanic, he inspects it, says the brakes are shot, all the struts are rusted out. 
Now, I could be wrong, but checking this car over before selling it probably should have revealed all of these issues. Right? 
We are now facing putting more money into it than it's worth to fix it, or scrapping it. Beyond aggravating. Why not be honest up front about the condition of the car?? Lesson learned.",-1
"526",1,"Worst place ever. Went there for happy hour and pizza but was told happy hour drinks only available at the bar. Okay, so we went to the bar where there were no customers or a bartender. Asked what may have been the manager if we could get happy hour drinks at a table by the bar. He said yes.  Nobody served our table even though there was a waitress standing there looking at us. A waiter with a cast came and told us gruffly that he is busy and would attend to us in a few minutes. Other waitstaff standing around doing nothing. We asked for margaritas and were told that they are not included in happy hour even though the restaurant website said cocktails were included. Very rude people and  we walked out of the restaurant. First time I have done that in maybe 10 years. Never go there!",-1
"527",2,"Not very happy.  Ordered a Breakfast Burger.  Waiter asked me how I wanted it cooked and I requested Medium.  Somebody else bought the food.  I cut the burger in half and it was Well Done.  No pink in the center.  Well Done to me means a dry burger.  I waited and waited for our server.  Finally gave up and ate half the burger watching the others at my table finish up eating.  Our sever never returned until everybody was done (except me of course), plus... the two kids needed drink refills.  

Since everyone was done, I wasn't going to hold things up asking for a new burger.  However I showed the rest of my burger to our server and told him to inform the cook.  The look I got from him was ""yeah, right...""

Based on that experience, I doubt I will ever come back.  ""It's the food stupid"".",-1

"531",1,"I started my journey with Jackson Ruiz in August when I came in with the goal to be blonde, my hair was healthy and long and had already had ombr├® and some highlights to blend it all together. My colorist was Michael, he seemed like he knew what to do and that we could accomplish it. It was going to take time, which I more than understood. 

The first service was great, I loved how blonde I got to be in just one service! It was the next three that left me horrified. I came back for my next service when a CSR called and said she could get me in earlier but it wasn't with the same stylist, I asked if I should wait but she assured me that they had the formula and knew my needs as Michael did. I came in and the girl added lowlights to my hair.... LIKE WHAT?! I thought I was going blonde?! I was pretty upset but they offered to fix it for free the next day with Michael. He went in and lifted my ombr├® to be higher, it didn't blend with the top of my head at all and I had a pink stripe across the back of my head! He claimed it was from previous services. I left unhappy once again but I paid for my service and Michael assured me that they would work on it the next time I came in. 

I walked around with my hair looking like a mess for a month, I went back in yesterday and saw Michael again, we talked for about 30 before we came to a decision about what to do with my hair, he told me he couldn't guarantee getting the pink out of my hair!!!!! Plus it was like 6 different colors. He could consulted with another stylist, Kim who seemed confused by his methods and asked the manager I get my service for free before we even started! I gave up on my blonde dream and just asked we did an all-over brown to just get my hair one color again. 

First Michael put a filler on my hair and then I picked a color I liked that was pretty dark. They offered to even dye my extensions for free which I thought was pretty nice. Then when I was done rinsing out color I got my hair cut by Abby, I couldn't stop crying in the chair because my hair was so much shorter than when I started this process in August, my beautiful healthy hair had been ruined. Then, she steps away because all my color across the back came out splotchy!!! All I asked is they make my hair one color and I'm still walking out of the salon with 4 different colors on my hair!!! When I left I was so horrified I couldn't stop crying! They offered to fix it for free again but all they've done is ruin my hair for free and I don't want to keep over processing it. Needless to say I took my extensions and told them to cancel any future appointments. I'm pretty fed up with the continuation to ruin my hair even if it is for free. I walked across the street to Wild Orchid so I'm really hoping they can work with me but so far in my consultation at least the stylist was HONEST about what she could and couldn't do with my hair and even made comments about how uneven my haircut was and told me what treatments needed to be done before my appointment. I'd rather pay to have my hair done right then go to Jackson Ruiz and continue to have them ruin it for free.",-1

I can never find parking close to my building anymore, it takes at LEAST 4-5 trips to the office to put in maintenance requests for anyone to ever come look at the problem, the carpets had fleas when we moved in, our bathrooms were moldy and in shambles...the list is endless
2 of the worst current features in my opinion are 1) the construction happening all around the complex. It started weeks ago, is the loudest thing you've ever heard, and Lamar is about to be down to one lane for like the next year, so traffic will be your new best friend. Good luck even turning out of the building. 
And 2) a big reason we picked woodmoor initially was because of the on-site gym. Well, big surprise, about 3 out of every 4 times I go, the treadmills are broken. Both of them. Not to mention it is completely filthy inside.

There wasn't enough salt to the dish so I had to recook the dish and to add more salt and get the lemon taste out. The Bead was different but it wasn't for me. It tasted like sourdough bread and again I am not a big fan of sourdough bread. 

My salad has sand in it which that make me really mad. I guess they didn't clean the salad that well this time. Ya that wasn't fun biting into sands. I might or might not come back here again. This place wasn't for me.",-1
"536",1,"This is the first gym I ever got a membership to about a year and a half ago.  When signing up I explained to the manager that I worked out of town and if I decided to go work back up north that I wouldn't need my membership anymore.  He said he would make note of it and would cancel it himself even if I didn't move.  Four months in the manager left for another location without me knowing and when I tried to cancel my membership they told me I couldn't unless I actually moved my permanent residence somewhere where a Steve Nash was not located.  I guess that's what I get for taking someones word and ended up paying for it for another 8 months. 

Also, the parking is HORRIBLE! I have never seen worse.  Must have seen at least a half dozen accidents in that four months and if you go at a bad time your waiting 20 minutes or more for a spot.

I ordered 2 lunch specials-- the Alaska Don (salmon nigiri, salmon roe (ikura) in a rice bowl) and 3 hand rolls.

The Alaska Don was particularly sad. 5 measly pieces of fish, barely a cup of rice, and 2 tablespoons of roe. Total disappointment for $14. The roe did not taste fresh or high quality-- it was slimy in texture. I had this same dish at Yama Sushi and Izakaya https://www.yelp.com/biz/yama-sushi-and-izakaya-portland?osq=Yataimura+Maru For $3 more the portion was at least double or triple in size and the fish was much fresher. 

The 3 hand rolls were sad and lackluster-- nothing to write home about.

The Honda Air Condenser issue has been on going for 10 years now with class action lawsuits filed and awarded for up to 40 million dollars! Since Honda knows this happens to 5,000 Honda's a year then sadly the truth must be told.... they used to charge $3,000 to fix the AC condenser but now charge $600-$700. The part costs $143 or $148 dollars and takes 9 minutes to install. 

Honda is making an extra $3,135,000 off its customers a year by purposely including the design flaw in their vehicles.

I read these reviews and I honestly wonder if there are a different set of staff for some of you than for others.  The funny thing is that I've come here every now and then for what must be 20 years now, first on Huron and then to its current spot, and the staff here has always been like this.  Almost every time I've been to Emma's, I overhear an employee speak down to a customer, and no staff member there has ever been truly friendly or pleasant, in fact I can't recall seeing a smile on a staff member's face to anyone.  They are extremely nice, obviously, to some people, and extremely rude to others.  Do you know which one you'll be?   

It's a shame when a restaurant has great food (they do, clearly) but you find yourself wondering how to obtain it without any contact with the staff or setting foot in the tiny, uncomfortable space.

Worse is the noise. What a racket in there. The acoustics are all wrong. The layout is just plain nonsensical. Huge circular bar in center clogging up valuable table space. You have an open kitchen where all you hear is yelling over which you try to have a conversation--impossible. As my bro' said, ""This is definitely not a place to take a date.""

When I asked for a menu, the waitress just asked me what I wanted and tried to improvise it seems. I ordered a glass of Prosecco while my mother ordered a Bellini. When she brought the drinks, my Prosecco was pink (appeared to be a rose Prosecco, which is new to me) and my mother's Bellini looked like a Mimosa (with an orange in it). She didn't provide much explanation as to why my Prosecco was pink (fine) but then she proceeded to take it away from me before I was finished - my ultimate pet peeve. The rest of the experience felt rushed, I think all in were were there for under an hour. 

For the amount we spent each ($45 for the buffet, $10+ each for the drinks) it was not worth it. Will plan better next time and avoid this place.",-1
"553",2,"I came in because I had an Amazon Local deal, and I will never be returning. This was the strangest massage ever. The room smelled kind of like a stale gym locker room. While my massage therapist asked me if she should spend the entire time on my shoulders, as that's where I had indicated most of my tension was, and I asked that she please do my whole body, she spent virtually no time on my shoulders, and I think they are worse now than when I went in. And now I have a headache. She also did something to my legs that made my calf feels like it had a muscle spasm.

EDITED on 8/8/2015. I went back yesterday and my massage therapist was named Lucy. DEFINITELY ask for Lucy. She did amazing things to all my sore muscles and I felt so much better afterwards. The atmosphere is still odd, and as is the very clinical smell of the place.",-1
"554",2,"I love trivia night but the service is usually pretty bad. Yesterday the server got my order wrong and I was super nice about it. Then later my husband was on his way so I ordered him wings and fries. My party had been waiting almost an hour for their food by that time and when the food came out I was given wings and fries by the runner (I assumed they just made them at the same time given that it took them that long). One guy at our table ordered the same thing and didn't have his food so the server came by and basically belittled me about how I ordered later so I should have known my husband's food would have come out later. I didn't really say anything but I am sure I had that ""are you kidding me?!"" look on my face so she avoided me the rest of the night and didn't bring my any refills. But she did auto-grat my table so I had to tip her the same for getting my order wrong and then being insanely rude to me later. So, that was awesome.",-1
"555",2,"Had breakfast here and was underwhelmed.  The Works Omelette was light on the filling and heavy on eggs which tasted very ""cookie cutter.""  The service was a little off, too, as I had to ask a couple times for water and my wife's breakfast was missing the salsa, so she had to ask for it on the side.  Also, the coffee was sour which is unfortunate for a place that apparently prides itself on its coffee (they sell the beans at the front of the store).",-1
"556",1,"We have several chain restaurants near our home in North Austin. We have used their online or telephone ordering for curbside service and have been mostly happy. We thought we'd try Red Robin, as we heard their burgers were good. We placed our order between 7:30-7:45p in hopes of having those burgers before it got too late. We figured since it was past traditional dinner rush, it wouldn't be too long a wait to get our order.

I arrived at curbside and called the number posted on the sign. The employee told me the order would be right out. After over 10 min, I phoned back to ask if it was indeed out shortly. They asked again who I was, and told me they'd have to check. Again, I was told it'd be right out. After nearly 10 more minutes they brought the order out and I drove home. It took much longer than anticipated, but we were happy to have the order. After arriving home we had completely the wrong order, not one item in the bag matched what we'd ordered. I drove back to the restaurant to simultaneously be met at the counter with a frustrated customer who was informed that I had taken her order. She expressed frustration at me (as though I wanted her burger with pineapple on it. Eww). 

I spoke with the manager. Yet, after another substantial wait, received the order. I arrived home after 9p and the burgers went right into the refrigerator. It was simply too late, close to bedtime to eat a heavy burger.

As I rewarm the burger today with guacamole that has now browned and lettuce that may have once been not wilted, the description of the burger quality doesn't match what is sitting on my plate. Perhaps they more closely match when you can eat it right after it's prepared. 

In summary, we were not happy with the experience and we wouldn't recommend the restaurant for you either. There are simply too many good choices in Austin Texas to endure substandard service.",-1

Since I was adding some leisure time to the tail end of this business trip, I decided to use Avis.  What a disappointment.  The car received was a very very worn bare-boned Jeep Patriot.  The interior was in bad shape, the brakes squeaked constantly and the car's ride was terrible.  By far the worst rental experience in years from any company.  I'm sure Avis would have swapped the car if I'd returned to the terminal, but with tight timing it wasn't possible.  My concern is why would a car of this poor safety and quality ever be rented by a company like Avis.",-1
"569",1,"Offended and annoyed by a staff member at Blue Fin. My fiancee and I just got married a few days ago. Tonight we went to Blue Fin and we were having a wonderful time reminiscing about our honeymoon and laughing when a grumpy woman came up to us and asked if we'd had anything to drink prior. We weren't being that loud at all, just enjoying each others company.  So we basically got a visit from her at our table because we were happy and laughing and having a nice time. It was ridiculous. The words offended and appalled sum up our experience. If you want to get visits from grumpy staff members--go ahead. We had started eating there a lot recently, but we will never go back. To be hones the sushi is not spectacular, but it is not terrible either. There are amazing places downtown, but living in Porter Square it was the most convenient place to go.",-1

The pork belly and the fish tacos were delicious. The corn on the cob and plantains were good, as well. The falafel, clauflower, and shrimp tacos were all gross!

"574",1,"Where do I start... I would give Zero stars for the apartment and management. First of all, there was no mention of any cleaning or insurance fees when we phoned to confirm our stay and specifically asked for the total amount the morning before we arrived. They added $90+ for cleaning and insurance when we got there and said that the extra fees are displayed somewhere in the fine print on the website where we booked.

The apartments are so darn old, dusty and has a depressing d├®cor and inadequate lighting. The furniture looks and feel so cheap perhaps from the early 80s. I could not stop sneezing from the dust in the air and on the furniture. The cable did not work most of the time and there was no WiFi access because the phone line was actually down. The AC did not cool the apartment down and there is a warning on the thermostat not to put below 75F or it will freeze!

The bathrooms are so outdated with broken tiles in the showers and rust on the air vents.

We ordered the calamari for an appetizer it was over cooked and pretty thinly cut. The marinara was bland and didn't have much flavor.. I think that the calamari at Mia Bella and McCormick and Schmicks is much better. My burger was suppose to be cooked medium well and it was brought to me a little more pink than I like and it was surprisingly actually dry. The beef lacked seasoning. The fries that came with my burger were ok a few pieces tasted old and stale for some odd reason. The side of sweet potato fries we ordered were burnt and tasted burnt. The beef tacos were not good. The thin corn tortillas were nuked in the microwave and had a weird chewy texture.

"577",2,"It's a few blocks from my house and it serves vegan breakfast.

That should give it 5 stars.

Unfortunately, the vegan options are half-assed and they make it clear that they don't really care about vegan food.

The veggie sausages are not vegan (seriously, how hard is it to get non-meat sausages that all of us can eat?) and the vegan margarine is the wierd whipped hydrogenated oil kind that doesn't actually melt.

So for breakfast, my choice is either a tofu scramble or corncakes.  The homemade veggie burger is good but again, the bun isn't vegan, so you have to get it on sliced bread if you are vegan.  And a burger on sliced bread isn't so good.

I spoke to a waiter once about the vegan issues and he basically said that the owner doesn't care, isn't going to bother no matter how many people complain or make suggestions.

I told them I was not told when I signed up about the fee. So I asked for the manager and got the owner and she proceded to tell me her front desk girls 100 % of the time tell new clients about the fee. No one is perfect I told her but then she tried to make me feel guilt because now the therapist would not get paid. I told her had I known about the fee I would not be upset but not knowing   makes a difference. She was very unprofessional. She did finally refund my gift card.

I made a reservation for an full size SUV at this location couple of days ago to be picked up on Friday march 17th. Yesterday I received a phone call from enterprise at this location , asking me to confirm that I am coming to pick up my reserved car , she followed up by asking me if I have a credit card because this SUV is not to be rented unless you have a major credit card , my answer was yes I do have a major credit card , she continues with are you sure ? I replied yes , then she asked again it doesn't say a debit or check card on it right ? Here I felt offended and degraded , coz she is assuming ahead that I am stupid , which I really do not appreciate that . Well you want to ask a question you need to be careful not to offend the person . So I quickly ended the phone call coz I started to be agitated . I waited 10 min and I called back the gentleman who answered the phone call was defending in a way the action of the lady that called me , yet he try to make things nicer to me , but kept offering excuses , some are understandable and some are not .
Point is do not judge people you don't know ,and be careful how you choose your words , don't assume that people are stupid .because may be they are way smarter than you are.

Now onto the service. When I ordered my Pho, I had received items (tripe) that I had not ordered in my soup and found it lacked what I had requested (tendon), the waitress prompted the chef and we were surprised to find the chef come out from the kitchen, pick up the chopsticks I was using and sift through my pho to show me that she had put the smallest piece of tendon in the soup.

"591",1,"Before I start this review, let me just say this: last night's dinner at Trattoria di Monica was to celebrate my birthday. I am also seven months pregnant and way overly excited by food.

Ye be warned.

My husband made surprise reservations at Trattoria di Monica for 8:30 on a Saturday night. Reservations on a saturday night in the North End are a must (or so I thought; turns out they don't actually mean crap at Tratttoria di Monica). I was really excited to give this place a shot, because the menu is pretty appealing and the reviews generally positive. We arrived just before our reservation and checked in the the hostess, who told us patrons were taking their time and therefore all reservations were approximately 15 minutes behind.

""No worries, we can wait"", I said. I was starving and definitely in the mood to eat, but what's 15 more minutes for a meal that looks and smells like it has the potential to be life-changing?

Well, quite a lot actually, when 15 minutes turns into 30, then 45, then 50...

My husband and I joined the throng of people milling around outside, waiting patiently for their own reservations. Turns out, after sparking up conversations with the six separate groups standing out on that cold sidewalk, that many of them had been waiting for their tables since 7:45. 

It was nearly 8:50 at this point.

We all start gathering around the windows, hoping all the people sitting on their checks and nursing their final sip of wine will take the hint that other people are waiting to eat their dinners. 

Nope. 

Then we notice the wait staff  begin prepping two tables, and we all think, ""huzzah! some of us are going to get to eat soon!"" Rounds of excited murmurs circle the sidewalk, all of us focused on these two tables like they're a lifeline.

Then, out of nowhere, a random group of people march down Prince Street, pass the throng of hungry and anxious would-be diners, and parade right through the front door of the restaurant like they own the place. They circle the table like vultures and sit, making themselves quite at home as the wait staff flock to them like moths to a flame.

""What the heck?"", we poor souls on the sidewalk all exclaim in unison. 

It turns out that Tuuka Rask, goalie for the Boston Bruins, was also in the mood for some Italian. An ""unexpected party of six was being seated at the request of the owner"", the hostess immediately explains to six very annoyed and starved groups of customers.

Point to note: being a famous goalie helps you get faster service.

Apparently, the owner of Trattoria di Monica doesn't cater to the plebs. 

(You, Mr. Restaurant Owner, are a bad business man and an even more shallow human being.)

So, since I'm seven months pregnant, freezing, ravenous at this point, and not at all intimidated by athletic celebrity (a rarity for a Boston sports fan, I know), I immediately sought the hostess out and informed her that six groups were ready to mutiny if they were not seated immediately, and that it was highly unprofessional of any business to ignore its patrons for so long without some level of consideration.

To their credit, the wait staff was overwhelmed and trying very hard to over compensate, but it was too little, too late. The damage was done.

One hour after our reservations, we were all finally seated. The hostess informed my husband and I that part of our meal would be comped for the inconvenience, which was a nice gesture on the part of the owner, but pretty sad when the bill came and we determined that one small appetizer costing $8 has been deducted. 

Dude, you couldn't even comp my husband's wine? Man, that's weak.

I will admit that the food was delicious, so my compliments to the cooking staff. Unfortunately, the whole experience was so unexceptional that I have no desire to recommend Trattoria di Monica to anyone, nor eat there again. The North End is filled with incredible restaurants, and there isn't anything about the Trattoria di Monica experience that places this establishment above any of the others.

Do yourselves a favor and take your business and hungry bellies elsewhere.

And just to add: Tuuka Rask didn't even play last night, so thanks for the good game, Chad Johnson.",-1

"593",2,"My friend and I came here on a whim. We decided to road trip from Indy to Cbus and went with this place. It was in a perfect location, it was reasonably priced, and they had rooms available for when we walked in. 

First impression, it looks like a big apartment building or something of that sort. The front desk attendant was so friendly and helpful. Let us get settled into our room before we had to move our car across the street for the $10 parking. Overall, this experience was good. 

We got into our rooms. We were in a room that faced a building across a walkway. You could see 100% into their offices and they could see in ours. It was a bit weird to say the least to have to close the blinds to get dressed. The rooms were recently renovated, and they weren't bad at all (decor and visually). They even came with a microwave and a fridge. There was some minor issues with some wallpaper coming down in the bathtub area, but nothing I couldn't live with. The towels were rock hard and felt like you were rubbing yourself with sandpaper when drying off, though. 

My biggest issue came when I was getting ready for bed and found a large pile of hairs that weren't mine under my pillow. Normally, I don't mind, but because it was right by my head, I decided to call down to the front desk to have them come and change it. A new attendant answered and said that he had higher priority things to do, he would get to it when he could. This rubbed me the wrong way, so I decided to call the number they advised if guests had any issues. A kind woman answered and helped to resolve the issue, adding the attendant also had an attitude with him. He eventually came, didn't say a word aside from asking which bed to change, and left. No apology, nothing. 

The next day, the phone rang (a third time in less than 24 hours). The assistant general manager greeted me with her name and title and apologized for the treatment. She gave an excuse as to why he treated me this way, but took it back and said it wasn't a reason for his attitude. She also gave me $40 off my stay. I let her know that I didn't want to get anyone in trouble, but wanted to let her know that this kind of treatment and personality is a reason to never come back or recommend the place. She said she understood. 

We checked out after we had the continental breakfast (hard boiled eggs, muffins and bagels and toast, yogurt, and juices), and the new attendant let us know that the bill had been zero'd out. I was sort of shocked, but I waited a few days and my credit card had been cleared.

This one is dirty, as the other reviews suggest, and do not have better prices to make going here worth it.  The fruit and veggie selection is limited and not very fresh.  There are some shady characters who hang around the lot sometimes.  The staff is not particularly helpful (although some are nice enough).  And typically when I go here, I have to go to another store to get a few more items to complete my list.  I am choosing to drive an extra mile from now on to avoid this disappointing store.",-1

The food was delivered very hot and very fast--both good things.  However, the quality of the food is not what I was expecting.  Nothing had very much flavor, and there were a lot of bright, unnatural, colors.  I ate the food and it was alright with the pickle that came along with it...but my husband declined to eat anything even though he was hungry.  It was, shall we say, rather unappetizing though perfectly OK.",-1

The cost is reasonable ~30 dollars per person at night, so if you are hoping to eat as much as you can, this is a decent option. If you were hoping to catch a deal at a place providing quality food, this place strikes out.

"603",1,"I know everyone likes this place, but I didn't like it one bit.

The wait was long and stupid because we had to wait standing up and next to the bar, which of course entices you to buy a drink. It wouldn't bother me waiting, but what does bother me is to see all these empty tables while you're just standing in line. I mean, couldn't we just sit and wait sitting down? It is what it is, every restaurant is different.

What really got to me was that once I got to the counter to order my food, they were out of my type of burger. I know it's not the wisest for a vegetarian to come to a burger restaurant, but I was with a group of friends who are non vegetarians. I asked the cashier what she suggested and she said ""umm i don't know, a salad? *giggles*""  Yeah, not funny after waiting for over 20 minutes just to be told I have to get a stupid overpriced salad.

We place the order and then we're told that our table was outside and they told us the number for our table. Sure enough, the tables weren't numbered and we were just annoyed by that point, that we sat down at whatever table was available. THEN we still wait another 15 minutes for our food, just to get a sad, highly-acidic, rip-your-tongue-out balsamic vinaigrette salad. 

Our waiter showed up ZERO times aside from the initial time that he got us waters.

We walk in and it's very, very crowded (totally understandable on new year's day) so we head to the bar to order our takeout wings. We couldn't have any alcohol on that day but the beer selection looked stupendous. 

And here's when it happened. As I looked at the menu I was disheartened to find that THERE WERE NO TERIYAKI WINGS. I mean, yeah it might sound like I'm putting needless emphasis on this point, but really? Lots of other wing flavor options, but not the age old staple teriyaki? Deal breaker.

"606",2,"Holy crap, this store is RUDE. (I'm from Brooklyn so i know about rudeness firsthand).  I always treat people the way I want to be treated. 

The first time I came in, I chalked up the rudeness to being busy. But, then I remembered that there was NOBODY in the store, nor the pharmacy drive through. Went in to grab my son's Rx that was dropped off the day before. It wasn't ready (it happens). The pharmacist gave me the biggest attitude because HE tried calling me and had the wrong # (They had in their system that my phone # started with a 1). HOW MANY PHONE# do you know start with the #1)?, and then was annoyed because he had to call the insurance company to verify eligibility. I felt like asking him ""Do you need me to go behind the counter and do your tech's work, as well as fill the pills in the bottle before I am on my merry way""?But I didnt. I just smiled, and said id be back the next day to pick up the medicine.

The only reason I gave it two stars instead of 1 was the Avocado Margarita which was delicious but also very over-priced.",-1
"609",1,"Oh dear. Where do I start?

I opened my account online. I deposited online. Because they limit what you're allowed to deposit via the mobile app (a ridiculously low amount for the first several months), I had to take a check to this location to complete my deposit.

I deposited on the mobile app just over five days ago (it is now after business hours on June 7th). I went in to deposit the balance of what I needed to have in the account three days ago. TD Bank has elected to hold my deposits for seven days because their policy says they can, and because, as some anonymous E-mail dolt named David said via E-mail, the ""deposits are being held for extra verification."" The problem with this is that the bank the checks were drawn on verified and paid on them pretty much immediately (I checked). There was zero justification for ""extra verification.""

I resent being lied to. Especially by a bank.

Dolt David then told me to contact my local ""store manager"" to get this taken care of, because that individual is the only one with the discretion to rectify the matter.

I didn't open my account at a local ""store."" All of my deposits, save one, have been made either by direct deposit, or via the mobile app. Someone needs to explain to me how a local ""store manager"" is going to fix what s/he has very little to do with. 

There's something wrong when a bank hides behind a policy and a fictional need for ""extra verification"" to keep one from getting to one's funds to PAY BILLS. 

Dolt David didn't seem competent enough to directly address my legitimate concerns, and I don't think that I should be inconvenienced by having to go to a ""store"" to talk to a manager to get funds that have already been ""verified"" accessible. That their policy says that they CAN hold funds UP TO seven business days, until an account has been open for more than 30 days, there is no real reason to do so if a situation doesn't legitimately warrant it. 

When I went into this bank to make my deposit, the staff was friendly. But had I known that I'd be lied to and have my funds held long after they'd been verified and PAID by the other bank, I'd have run out the door.

I'm pondering contacting the federal reserve about this. If this is how TD Bank treats its customers, I'd have been better off staying with BoA, which is a nightmare bank.

My advice? Stay clear of TD Bank, unless you like being jacked around.",-1
"610",1,"Two words. Rude and Shady. In the city of Boston, all tow companies are SUPPOSED TO HAVE AN AUTHORIZATION PROVIDED BY THE DISPATCH COMPANY BEFORE THEY HOOK A CAR FOR A TOW. 

Allston. I hate this disgusting city. When I visit my friend he calls his landlord every time I'm there, then his landlord calls Roberts towing and tells them my car make and plate, (it's a vanity plate, NOT hard to forget) saying ""hey this car is authorized to park."" 

Tonight I parked visible to Longs Ave. not even 5 minutes at my friends we hear a tow truck swarming. Good thing I was there. According to this employee ""Because my car didn't have that white Roberts towing sticker"" I was guilty. 

When I asked this cowboy why he's towing my car he had the balls to tell me to ""let him do his job"" after he hooks up my Mini. THEN he called his dispatch to ask if my car was authorized to park on Long Ave. YEAH IT WAS! My friend asked the driver if he would have called in my plate before he towed it if we weren't there. He said ""oh of course."" REALLY?! Would you have really?! Find that hard to believe seeing that's protocol before you take someone's private property. 


Back up, Roberts.  Stop being so greedy and assuming everyone is parked illegally. Follow the Massachusetts laws and start towing like professionals. 

Maybe this company can take these stupid college kids for a ride. This isn't my first rodeo. Not only should I have called boston PD, I will be filing a complaint with whoever I can Monday morning. I am sure Roberts could careless. If I could give these people less than a star I would.

8/19 so it's Roberts policy to hook up a car before they find out if they're a no tow? Are you kidding me? Is that even legal? 

I'm not claiming anything I have three witnesses. You even said your driver ""didn't recognize my car and thought I was good to tow"". HOW THE HELL WOULD HE KNOW THAT WITHOUT CALLING YOU FIRST? Why couldn't he have called while in the street? Why did he have to come up the driveway and hook my fregin car. You don't get why I'm upset because it didn't happen to you or your personal property.

"612",1,"Very inflexible with scheduling and insensitive to the value of his customers' time and work schedules, doesn't return calls, rude on the phone, and overall just unprofessional attitude.

Long story short, what really angered me about working with this guy is that he schedules appointments in 4-hour blocks that apparently only indicate which day he'd like to show up.  

Mind you, this repair is a simple 5-minute replacement job for a commonly-occurring problem with this appliance.  I am only having it done through my home warranty because the $60 service fee is (I thought) a bargain compared to the $300+ part.  Not so when you factor in the lost time of working with this guy. 

The first appointment was made in an afternoon back in February (finally, after several unreturned voicemails) through a referral by my home warranty provider.  He called that morning, and made little effort to hide his annoyance at not being able to show up 3 hours early.  He couldn't make the appointment, and we had to reschedule.  For this appointment, he did show up within the window, but only gave 5 minutes' notice (was supposed to give at least 30) prior to his arrival.  He identified the issue and would return with the part next appointment.

Second appointment, a month later.  Presumably, he has identified the problem and is scheduled to come in from 1-5pm.  He calls at 11:30, wanting to come over immediately.  Wanting this to be behind us, we rush home and agree to let him come early, yet he doesn't show up till 12:30, with the wrong part, and a with an explanation obviously contrived with the arrogant assumption that we're just dumb consumers who have no idea how this stuff works, in order to hide his mistake.

Third appointment to fix the same issue, now it's mid-April, scheduled for 9am-1pm, and has been asked for a minimum 45-minute notice prior to arrival.  He calls at 8:30.  We say we'll be about 10-15 minutes late, given the lack of notice.  He says that if we're not there right at 9:00, he isn't waiting because he has another appointment to get to.  Rudeness aside, I am *livid* that we previously afforded him flexibility while he is unwilling to return the favor.  Basically, I told him that if he can't make this appointment work, we're having someone else do the job.  He didn't stick around, and we got someone else.  

I'm not insensitive to the fact that this kind of job is difficult to schedule precisely; I'm a field technician myself, and I'm very familiar with the process of troubleshooting.  But I also understand the stresses of providing good service, and about the importance of treating customers with respect.  

If your time means nothing to you, or you have the flexibility of being able to be  home all day waiting for him to show up whenever is most convenient for him, maybe you won't have a problem with this guy.   But I won't tolerate this, even if it means losing 2 more days of work to get my point across.",-1

And then not even an offer to order another beer for another 5-10 minutes. We were ready to say ok, one more, and maybe some food, but both bartenders avoided eye contact and only when I made an obnoxious move with my empty glass came over to us. We tabbed out. And we also had the ale trail guides to be stamped ... God forbid.

"621",1,"This is a real quick review.  I have been going to this Great Clips Franchise in Kyle, Texas for about seven years and have watched a the quality of service has rapidly declined over the past six to eight months.  If you need a quick hair cut which is rather simple, then they might work for you.  However, checking in on line is a must with the average walk in waiting about 20-40 minutes.  However, anything more than that - would recommend you go elsewhere.  The reason is the high turnover rate of the stylist with many of their best quitting within the last few months.  In addition, the counter personnel are often rude.  In particular, I logged in before leaving work yesterday in order to ensure ample time for the crowds.  When I arrived, the counter person stated that I was not on the list, though I received a confirmation of the call ahead.  The person further stated that I wanted to log in or get on the list it would be about a 1  1/2 hour wait.  When I tried to explain, I was basically treated as though I was lying.  My long time patronage did not get me the benefit of the doubt.  This wasn't the first time that I have experience poor customer relations.  The first time, my regular stylist was out so I had a different one.  The young lady could not understand the notes from the computer.  I attempted to explain, but ultimately decided to walk out.

So today rainey day perfect day for a pho ""i thought""  i order a 12 and he order his favorite dish 41.  Asked to substitute steam rice for fried rice.   They'd brought him ""chicken fried rice"".  Chicken not even closed to the flavor of the grilled chicken.  We called the server and then another guy came.  He said they dont do substitutions anymore.  And that if we want it grilled chicken it will come with steam rice. Even when we said we were willing to pay extra for the special request.  He said ""no, I can't do it"".

What ruined it for us was our server. The entire group left pissed off, stiffed the waiter and talked poorly about their experience outside. It's sad that my girlfriend left the restaurant she chose disappointed and upset on her birthday because of a horrible server.

We had a 16-top on July 12th for my girlfriend's birthday. It started off just fine, with one person covering our table. I can't remember the server's name, but he was horribly rude. He asked us to stay in our specific seats for convenience in splitting the checks. I was a server for years, I understand this, but I don't ask my tables to do this... that's just selfish... let the customer do what makes them happy (aside from letting them ruin other guest's experiences)... it's a freaking birthday, people want to say hello and take pictures with each other. Be better organized. Everybody kept to their specific seating arrangement except for TWO people. Right away he goes to get the check, drops it split for like 3 people and leaves the remaining $86 for the rest to figure out and saying he can't do it. This server then proceeds to ARGUE with me over it, because I'm sitting there numbering everybody's order (doing his job). He starts snapping at me about how all these (imaginary, mind you) people were ""switching spots all over the place""... this is simply untrue... TWO people swapped seats and they were right next to each other. Our guests attempting to get the servers attention for a glass of wine, beer or refill are stormed passed and blatantly ignored. These are the reasons, Mr. Server, why you get stiffed. We were kind, considerate and well-mannered; we didn't deserve that.

There are plenty of restaurants in Portland with great food and MUCH better service.

EDIT: While I appreciate owner or management responses, this one is ridiculous. Again, two of sixteen people switched seats but the server insisted with a red and angry face that we were jumping all over the place, kept walking away from us flustered and ignored people needing refills or drinks. It was a BIRTHDAY, people walk over and say hi to each other and take pictures. All but TWO (2) people were in their original seats. The server could have asked a simple ""did anybody move?"" Instead, he throws the check on the table and acts like a jerk. When he saw me trying to figure out what everybody had since it was on one check, he came and argued with me and blaming us for his decision. He literally argued with me. Saying ""but I can assure you that wasn't his intention"" is blatantly ignorant. If that's the kind of customer service you want to defend with your response then go right ahead but it doesn't change the fact that you're defending poor customer service. When an entire 16-top leaves irritable and stiffs the waiter, something ain't right. Thanks for the response.",-1

"631",1,"Terrible experience. There weren't enough rooms available at art of animation during our trip (we stayed there the majority of our vacation) so we came to Pop Century. I didn't like the overall feel of the resort but rooms were newly remodeled. Our first night there we smelled marijuana coming through our vents (we have small children) so we immediately called the front desk. The front desk apologized and offered us an air freshener and checked around the hotel with security. They found nothing and didn't offer another room. The next night the smell was SO BAD ( coming from the bathroom vent) I had to shut the bathroom completely. We couldn't bathe or open that door at all. We called the front desk and a manager offered to stop by our room. He said the aroma was powerful but didn't understand where it was coming from since the vents aren't centralized. He offered to have a handy man change the filter. A handy man came and changed the filter in the bedroom. He said the vents in the bathroom ARE centralized so it was coming from someone's room. Which we figured. We called again and asked for another room. They said they didn't have any. We called again a few minutes later because we just could not handle being in that room and all of a sudden they had an extra room. My parents were in the joined room next door and said that all night people were in and out of that room complaining of the smell. Even the room service. When we got home we complained of the experience and were offered one free night IF we come back INSTEAD of discounting the night we stayed. Workers were rude by the luggage center and didn't offer any help. Workers were incompetent in the shop center. I'm so glad this was towards the end of our trip or it would have ruined our Disney stay.",-1
"632",2,"I purchased a couch and loveseat one year ago with the service warranty which is with a totally different budiness: Guardsman.
Guardsman claims to come out and fix any stain or defect.  All they've ever done is sold me overpriced stain remover to do it myself (It actually worked well but it should've been done by them....and free)
One month after owning the couch one of the center seams came loose and has been growing.  I've been call8ng Guardsman for about a year now and they say it's a manufacturer defect and I need to contact Mor.  Of course Not just sends me back to Guardsmen.  This time I filled out their extensive, online claim form to come out but after 3 weeks I was told its being denied again and to contact Mor....again. So I've called them aznd now that it's been just over a year its 60 to come out and more to do the work.  I explained the issue and they ""think"" they can waive the fee but their computers were down today so they said they'll call me back.  Hopefully they will co.e fix this for free...this has wasted a great deal of time and money on cleaning products I didn't even need.",-1
"633",2,"I'm trying to support this place, but they make it hard. Came in on a Sunday, there was barely any fresh meat for sale, was told the deliveries come in on Tuesdays. Came in late in the afternoon on Tuesday, the display case was empty. I believe it had come in but was not broken down yet, maybe? Came back on a Friday, was told, ""We don't have much of a selection of steak right now."" They do seem to have a selection of frozen meats at all times. But I'm not looking for frozen meat. Perhaps the cafe is good. I'm not sure. I didn't try it. I was excited about the butcher. But they can't seem to keep fresh meat in stock.",-1
"634",1,"I wanted to like Broadway Toyota service since they were so convenient for me.  However, their tactics seem sleazy, even when I just needed a service.  I called about the 45 K service, which I had looked up in my manual.  I wanted to add the extra items recommended for vehicles used for towing.  It turns out what Broadway Toyota has their own version of this list, which costs almost 3 times what the factory recommended service costs.  They also, recommended a fuel injector service ($130), even though the car was running fine (I mentioned the milage had dropped).  They said since I had not used Chevron gas or similar, the fuel injector system would be dirty and could be affecting my milage. That didn't sound right and consumer reports says it isn't.  I'm sorry; I wish it were different.",-1
"635",2,"We (2 of us) went yesterday afternoon - first thing I noticed was a non-nice odor at the booth we were led to.  I ignored that since I was in a very good mood.  My friend ordered a glass of ice water (along with our drinks) - but the waitress never brought his ice water until we asked her like 10 more times!  We both agreed that our drinks were great (Margherita & Bahama Mama) and we ordered an appetizer (calamari) along with our main course and the next thing the waitress brought (to my friend) was a little bowl of coleslaw.  The appetizer never came (I actually forgot about it myself) and we ordered a 2nd round of drinks (good again) then our meals came - we both happened to order the same dish (Wood-Grilled Lobster, Shrimp and Scallops) - the first thing I noticed is that everything on the plate was small or tiny lol.  So I was disappointed (to me it was not worth the steep-ish price).  My 2 sides (green beans & rice) were both good.  We reminded our waitress that we never got our appetizer (I won't name her).  After we finished our main course she showed up with the appetizer- but in a shopping bag (even though I never asked for it to be ""to go"").  I shrugged my shoulders and told her I needed to order desserts (to go).  She gave us an extra dessert which was nice (I ordered 4).  At home I was impressed with the dessert I ate (key lime pie) but it too was on the small side.  Too bad the service was lacking and the portions/sizes were small.  I think a better name for them is ""Kid's Lobster"" - I can't take RL very seriously.  Now for the drinks, I give them 4 stars!  The next time I want to eat out and have seafood - I will try and find a ""real"" seafood restaurant.  I was again hungry about 2 or 3 hours after going to RL and I heated up some left over pizza to feel full.",-1
"636",1,"Living in the neighborhood I have my choice of dozens of great places and ABO WAS a favorite BUT The service is ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC! Last night they were out of oysters.. I ate anyway but the service took FOREVER to do anything! EVEN TO GREET ME! Tonight I came back and the girl server was ARGUING and treating the server AWFULLY right in front of me!! She was bitching and telling every detail of her horrible day! It was a nightmare for me to watch and be subjected to! The Bloody Mary that comes with a shrimp ALWAYS all of the sudden doesn't anymore they said I had to pay extra and they forgot the old bay rim! Worst experience EVER!",-1
"637",1,"This is a horrible business.  The manager no responsibility for what happened. She laid the blame squarely on the corporate office. Evidently they had hundreds of orders for Mother's day, far beyond, their capacity and their corporate office kept taking orders. 

Their customer care center could not have been less helpful. The rep I spoke with knew nothing about how to help me an offered no solution other than opening a case. She never said what that would mean. 

Avoid this place at all costs.",-1

-My fiance, as we were leaving this restaurant.

I've lived a few blocks from this restaurant for over a year, but for some reason I never made it over there to try it till today.  It's not that I wasn't curious--I love the decor on the outside and it looks like the type of place I'd love. 

I was still optimistic when I went inside the restaurant for lunch. The decorations are modern, simplistic, and warm, and the greeter was very welcoming and explained the setup of the restaurant (order at the register, sit wherever you want). 

The veggie sandwich I ordered was OK, but it seemed like the sandwich hadn't been well-thought out--mediocre bread (a Kaiser roll) and a smattering of random vegetables served partially heated.  It tasted fine, but the flavor was not very refined--there were simply too many competing flavors in the sandwich (artichoke hearts, eggplant, tomato, raw onion, olive tapenade, guacomole, and more...).  I was disappointed that they served it with guacomole when the menu said avocado--the guacamole just added to the confusion in the sandwich. 

My fiance's spinach goat cheese pizza was fairly tasty, only because enough goat cheese can make anything taste good. The sauce on the pizza was fairly bland, and the crust was terrible (we both agreed we preferred the crust on a Tostino's microwave pizza). The crust was undercooked, flavorless, and formed in a perfectly even round disk which tells me they probably bought it at Costco's.

Maybe this place is better for dinner, but I won't be back to try it.",-1
"639",2,"Overly priced and lacking finesse. I stopped by this cart the other day and when I walked up the person running it was sitting at a table smoking. There's a sign above the cart touting their brisket so I ordered a brisket sandwich for $9. For an unusually high food cart price I was expecting something pretty fantastic and what I got instead was a tube shaped piece of tin foil with bread and overly thin beef inside. Nothing else. No chips, no sides, no drink, for $9. They have sauces you can put on your sandwich that were pretty good. The bread was better than average. The brisket was way below average, flavorless and had a rubbery texture.  

I definitely wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend the brisket.",-1
"640",2,"I want to like this place so bad, but I am having a hard time.  I've been with my wife twice, both times the service was very friendly, the food...First time we went for breakfast, the eggs were cooked well but nothing spectacular, the hash was undercooked for my liking - I like it with a little crisp and the hashbrowns were dry and not very flavorful.  Second visit we went for lunch.  My wife ordered the grilled chicken sandwich which seemed to have a piece of processed chicken, not real chicken breast, but one that comes prepackaged grill marks and all.  I ordered the cornbeef ruben which was awful!  It is hard for me to say that because again, the people there are very nice.  The one good thing were the waffle fries and the sweet potato fries, but it is obvious they are not homemade.

I hope they get their act together and start serving real, fresh food as it is a very inviting, comfortable, friendly place",-1
"641",2,"I planned my wedding from NYC but my parents are in the Boston area, so I went dress shopping there and fell in love with a sample dress.  The saleswoman was great - very helpful, not pushy.  When I tried to negotiate (as it was a sample at least 2 seasons out of date), she said they could cap the price of alterations at $400, but couldn't move on the price.  I asked how far out I needed a fitting since the dress was snug but essentially fit me except for needing to be shortened.  We scheduled an appointment for 8 weeks before my wedding.

I booked a trip from NYC to Boston specifically for the first dress fitting, and when I arrived on time, the seamstress wasn't available and they seemed to have no idea that I was coming.  They hadn't pulled my dress from storage and we had to wait for the seamstress.  Once we finally saw her and I got the dress on, she asked me if I was going to lose any more weight.  I said not really, maybe 5 pounds.  She said, okay well we can't do anything until then so come back in 4 weeks.  Seriously?!  Why didn't you say that earlier so I could save the full day of travel and train tickets?

Next appointment, again, no one was expecting us and we had to wait, but it was fine.  Seamstress pinned my dress and I scheduled my final fitting for 4 days before the wedding, the earliest I could do it because I had to travel from NYC.  I show up for that final fitting expecting to try on the dress and take it home, and NOPE, it's not done, just shortened and pinned.  Had to rearrange 3 vendor meetings to come back next day, while she acted like I was crazy for thinking I'd have the dress ready. I was worried about alterations being very expensive because the dress was lace, hence getting the alterations price capped.  Turned out I only needed minor alterations, but they still charged the full $400 despite all the scheduling issues. Staff people are very nice, just completely disorganized, terrible communication with clients.",-1
"642",2,"Dua is located in downtown Atlanta on Broad Street, right next to Peachtree Rd.  It can easily be confused with Dua II which is just further down the street on 63 Broad St.  You will find a diverse crowd at Dua, both in terms of service staff and customers.  You order your food on the 1st floor, and then you have the option of eating in one of two dining rooms, one on the main floor and one downstairs, with the latter being much bigger & classier.  

The area where you place your order is very crowded.  It seems as if the restaurant was a bit ambitious in squeezing dining tables on the main floor, eating into the space around the cash register.  You also are asked to pay gratuity upfront before you are provided service, which I found to be a bit odd.
      
I ordered the beef pho.  The soup had a little too much MSG, and I'm not sure what cut of beef they used, but its texture was a bit rough for my taste.  Also, becareful with the chili peppers because they are deceptively spicy.   

Dua has the potential to be a great place.  The prices are reasonable, and the basement dining room has a nice ambience, akin to some fine dining restaurants I've been to in the past(romantic lighting, hard oak tables, & exposed concrete brick walls).  Although I did not particularly like my pho, I am willing to give this place a second try.",-1
"643",2,"I've been wanting to try this place because we've lived in Austin for 4 yrs and have not found a really good Chinese place yet.
My husband and I went during the week at dinner time, so we did not have the dim-sum, we ordered off the menu.
I agree with the other posters on here that the wait staff needs to be a lot friendlier, they act like you are bothering them if you come to eat.  Also, they really need to scrub the place.  Cleanliness goes a long way in a restaurant.
The appatizers were not good, the ribs were really gross and greasy. I don't think that they were anywhere near fresh.
My dinner was the Sizzling Triple Crown.  Flavor was good, scallops very chewy.  My hubby had something different (can't remember the name), but he said it was pretty good.
I will try it again sometime to see if I happened to be on a bad night.",-1

I was greeted pleasantly and took the food with me, once I got home and we opened our food I was amazed to see that the teriyaki sauce was alomst non-existant on our chicken.

I'm seriously reconsidering not returning to this restaurant even though we live right down the street!",-1
"645",2,"Food was pleasantly good!  Service was bad, but not the fault of the server.  Server had too many tables for even a veteran server.  Most importantly for the rating was the fact that it is labeled a sports bar (which has the TVs for and sports packages for) but on a Friday night had curling on the big screen and was told there was no manager on duty to change the TVs.  Hence, no key NBA match ups like the Cavs vs Hawks on ESPN",-1
"646",2,"Oh you were so close to receiving three stars, my dear. So close. And then you started repeating songs after an hour and a half. Which makes me think that perhaps no one ever stays longer than that. Which means you have a high turnover... which probably means you suck.

The one time I did visit when it wasn't happy hour we waited 45 minutes for our burgers and when they came out they were totally cold, like not even the least bit warm. May as well have been in the fridge. We told our server and she halfway admitted fault ""Yeah, I thought I saw your food up a while ago"". Well, why didn't you grab it!?! So, we paid for our beers and left. Total waste of time. 

It gets pretty packed during happy hour, but when you're living on a budget, it's almost worth it for the cheap and decent burgers and good beers.",-1
"650",2,"Sadly, our visit today was subpar. The food was delicious, service was very lacking. We sat at our table on the patio and waited about 15 mins before being greeted by our server. Drink orders were placed and it took another 15 mins for half our drink order to come out (lemonade with fresh mint came without any mint even though the manager on duty who brought it out assured us it was right). The second drink, a simple Coke, still had not arrived. Appetizer was delivered, still no drinks. Lunch items arrived, still no drinks despite a second reminder. The coke finally arrived towards the end of finishing my meal however still no lemonade. We ordered a dessert (churros - fantastic!) and finally, as we finished up dessert and asked for our check the lemonade was delivered...almost an hour after being seated!!!!  Ridiculous. Check finally arrives and guess what...it's wrong. We were double charged for the 1 drink that we had to ask 2 people to fix and didn't arrive until after dessert was done",-1

"653",2,"I used to be a fan of 888. I loved their food and I always thought they were the one of the best asian restaurants in Austin until 2 years ago.

2 years ago, I went there with my friend for lunch, and as usual, we got pepper and salt chicken& beef hot pot. When foods came out, it looked very delicious, and hot pot tasted good. BUT the problem broke out when I tasted pepper and salt chicken. it wasn't chicken. it was like a squash, but not really squash. This thing happened before like twice, so I talked to the server but her attitude made me freaking mad. she eventually got me a new place with chicken, but the way she spoke to me was very impolite..I think she thought I told her to get an extra free food or something. ( so I didn't eat that new chicken one)

I stopped to go there for awhile..about year and half..
I went back last time and was satisfied..

HOWEVER, I went there last night and ordered pepper and salt chicken (I know, again) and green curry for to go. I am leaving austin this weekend so I wanted to try good places before I leave. so I drove down from arboretum area.  I waited for like 40min. I knew my foods are out, but the server only took care of dining-in customers. 
anyways, when I got home, bite the pepper and salt chicken, there was no chicken inside. NO FREAKING CHICKEN was there. 

what a disappointment.

I will not ever go back to that place. I will miss their beef hot pot though.
gosh. freaking salt and pepper chicken.. (pepper and salt? whatever)",-1

It came with a salad, hummus, and tabbouleh.  The salad and tabbouleh were both fine but nothing special.  The hummus was good and you got a whole pita bread with your meal which I liked.  The falafel was hard.  I mean, I couldn't get my fork through it hard.  Like someone dropped it in the deep fryer and forgot about it for an hour hard.  And it had an aggressive anise flavor that I didn't really care for.  Everything, the food, the service, the ambiance, was just okay.

"658",1,"This review is based upon my scheduling experience, as we never made it to the point of having maids reach our house. I first reached out to Maid for Portland to schedule an introductory clean about a month ago. We settled on a day that I was able to stay home from work in the morning to supervise the cleaners, as I have cats and don't feel comfortable with people in my house unattended. I stressed the importance of a reliable arrival time since I was missing work, and was told that it wouldn't be a problem. I was also asked for a credit card number over the phone. Within a day of leaving the credit card information, my debit card account showed several local, unauthorized charges and needed to be cancelled. While I acknowledge that this may have been coincidental, the timing and locality were suspicious. Regardless, we decided to proceed with the cleaning appointment.

On the day of the appointment, I was told that the maids would reach our house between 9:00 and 9:15. At 9:30, when no one had arrived, I called the office. They stated that there had been a mix up, and that the maids had arrived at the incorrect house and begun cleaning. After a half hour of back and forth phone calls, the dispatcher stated that the maids were unwilling to stop cleaning at the house they were currently at, and that arrival to my house would be delayed by at least three hours. I told the company that I could not miss that much work, especially since I had had a reserved time, and cancelled the clean. The owner/scheduler (Robyn) was very understanding and offered us a discount on further service if we wanted to try them again.

We decided to set up a schedule with another company but, due to availability, they were not able to start for at least another month, so we decided to give Maid for Portland one more try in the meantime. I scheduled another appointment, again with the guaranteed arrival time of 9-9:15, and this time with my husband staying home from work. My husband called me today at 9:30 to say that no one had arrived and, when I called the office, I was told that they had been unable to access their office this morning due to a misunderstanding about a keyholder, and that they would be at least an hour late. As my husband had only gotten time off for the amount of time scheduled, with frank assurances from Robyn that they would not be late and wouldn't take more than three hours, we cancelled the clean again. 

The quality of this service could be amazing, but the treatment from the scheduling office is ridiculous and insulting, and I would encourage working people who need to be aware of their time and have their schedule respected to look elsewhere for cleaning assistance.",-1
"659",1,"Worst hostess ever.  Lady with blonde hair, grabbed 2 menus walked passed us and yelled said ""follow me"" no smile, no hello nothing. Then I requested to sit at a booth and she rolled her eyes turn around waved her arm and said where do you wanna sit in the most rude tone. I don't get how people like that are allowed to be the first face you see when you walk in. That ruined my entire meal. Irritating when people are unable to act professional.",-1
"660",2,"Greatly disappointing. Sushi is good. Food from the kitchen is not that good. The place is in a horrible shape for a restaurant that opened just a year ago. Dirt and signs of wear everywhere... Bathroom is dirty. Table where we got seated was dirty. Pieces of green salad and food chunks stuck to the table top... Service is horrible. After 35 minutes passing by manager asked how was our food and we replied that we have not received anything. Only at that point our order got put into their system... After another 10 minutes we received the first item. Utensils are placed directly on the dirty table by the stuff and that is just disgusting. Ordered green tea donut dessert something. After a long wait something was brought from the kitchen that was... Red. Asked the waiter what was that as we ordered 'green tea donut'... He replied 'Oh that is red bean' and walked away... If I wanted a red bean I would of ordered red bean. I ordered green tea. Greatly disappointed and unhappy at that point I did not even want to bother. Two stars at best.",-1

"662",2,"Unlike any place we've been to.  Overall, we enjoyed it.  We went with a party of 9 for my daughters birthday.  She was really excited about the belly dancing!  This is the main reason we picked this place.  We got there a bit early for the dancing and almost didn't stay for it, which would have made it a very disappointing experience.  I'm glad we waited!  It made the whole visit.

Pro's: 
- The staff are friendly
- They belly dancing and music were the best part!  The dancer was fun and beautiful to watch!  She invited people to the dance floor and my daughters had a blast with her!  Even the 16 month old!  The music was played by a man who also sang and was great!
- The ambiance, especially when the dancer and musician were playing, is fun!  And the lights all around are pretty once the sun goes down.
- I had a toddler running around while we waited for our food, climbing on the stages and it was perfectly fine.

Con's:
- The food is just ok.  We ordered the Mezze plate, which wasn't as abundant as what they show on their website.  Three of us had the chicken sheesh kabobs and thought it was a bit over cooked.  Two ordered Shawarma and thought it was bland.  One ordered the salmon and thought it was bland and one ordered the lamb shank, which actually looked moist and yummy!  The falafels were good, but the baklava didn't have much flavor. 
- Service was slow.  There were only a couple of tables there, so I was surprised at how slow things came out.  One person finished their main course before their sauce came out.
- It feels a bit old and a lot dirty.  We passed through the inside pretty quickly, but I was happy we weren't sitting in there.  Outside, the tables are mostly a bunch of folding tables, which looked to rarely get a cleaning, placed on dirt.  One of the kids spilled a cup of water and when they wiped it, it was extremely dirty.  I don't think they get a regular wiping.  My toddler kept playing in the dirt, then wiping her nose and inhaling a ton of dust.  The bathrooms were yuck.  They need a serious cleaning and smell horribly of urine.

This is probably a great place to sit around and smoke hooka, if you are into that (we aren't), and bring your own bottle.  Probably best to come after dark so you don't see just how dirty it is.  Maybe not the best place for kids.
- A bit over priced because of that.  I ended up picking up the whole bill, to the tune of $220 with tip. Since only 7 of us ordered, this seemed a lot.",-1
"663",1,"Worst to-go food I think I've ever gotten. Items ordered below:

1.  Wings were terrible quality and they forgot to include the ranch I requested.  Managed to eat it but it wasn't good.
2.  Salad was just chopped lettuce.  Nothing else.  Gave it to the cat (actually loves lettuce).
3.  Southwest chicken wrap.  This was actually decent. Would probably give this 3 stars on its own.
4.  Fat Sean Sandwich with Marinara.  Inedible it was so bad.  Ate 3 bites and threw it away.

In addition, the food was 20 minutes late and somewhat cold.  I will never order from them again.",-1
"664",1,"Service wasn't great and the food wasn't all that great either. I had a fajita special and shrimp was hard and needed flavor. I've been to many seafood restaurants would not recommend this one.",-1
"665",2,"Showed up at 7:30ish and while there were a few tables open (good start considering no reservations), got stuck at the table right next to the entry way (my seat was actually in the walkway so when people came in or left, it was uncomfortable).  Overall, the first impression was terrible with being stuck in the aisle, the temperature was blazing in the place and the waitstaff didn't come by to greet us or describe how the menu worked for quite a while (not that we couldn't figure it out, but just not overly attentive). 

The wine list was nice because you could get most wines by the glass, quarter, half or full bottles.  This deserves more like 4-5 stars.  We had a glass of Cava each to start and then a nice Pinot in half bottle (which was perfect).  

We had bread (B- seemed burnt), olive oil (B just okay), cheese plate (B could have been an A with better description of what we got and maybe something like quince paste or almonds or hazelnuts etc), mushrooms(C- button mushrooms that seemed like they were from a can, not what I expected considering the time of year), Buffalo (B but only because I love Buffalo, nothing inventive here, also oddly presented sliced in a pile with a lemon wedge garnsih), Quail (A, the only really good dish), Beets and Tomatos (B-), Kale and Pecans (B).  All in, we ended up at $95 before tip.  

Overall, terrible seating (I don't mind close, but close and in a walkway is taking it over the line), mediocre food, good wine choices, bad temp control and mediocre waitstaff (although not bad enough to doc the tip).

I'd pass unless you just have to try it for yourself.",-1
"666",1,"Never got a chance to try the food. The server blamed the kitchen, but I was in full view of the kitchen and did not see a back up.

There are other places to eat in the airport, so try those instead. 

One star due to the service. 

Update: We then asked for our food to go, was told it would be right out. 10 minutes later we just got up to leave and stood in front of the register to pay for our two beers and forget the food. Finally the manager (Jody) came over and told us we could get our food and it would only take a few more minutes. (We ordered one of their regular sandwiches and a salad - not too tough to prep). We declined and then he told us he would take the food off our bill but we still had to pay for the beer. Bad, bad, bad customer service. I know they have captive and transient customers, but this was very poor management.",-1
"667",2,"I won't beat around the bush...the place sucks. Yes, the grounds are well maintained and the lobby is pretty...thats how they suck you in. They get you to sign the super-long, 15 month lease and then you're screwed. Move here if you want to pay $50 for a covered parking spot only to have all 4 wheels of your car stolen overnight (yes, this happened just the other night to at least 2 cars in the garage). Of course they refuse to hire any type of security. 

Move here if you like listening to every detail of your neighbor's sex life as well as peeing and stomping around all night. They really cheaped out on this place, no sound-proofing at all...we have lost countless hours of sleep due to this, and again, management treats it as not their problem. The cabinets may look nice and new and modern, but everything is constructed from particleboard! The day we moved in I went to open a kitchen drawer and the front of it fell off in my hand.

Also, it seems that the quality of tenants has dropped significantly as they became desperate to fill the place at any cost...the vibe on weekends is distinctly overgrown frat-boy, camped out on the lawn drinking Natty Light all day. If these are your peeps, then by all means move here! All in all, a crap complex in a crap town. We are seriously foolish for ever moving here, but luckily our lease is up in just a couple months. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. Oh, and I having a sneaking suspicion that the previous review is not a legit one.",-1
"668",2,"My friends and I went here almost every weekend when it first opened. We knew the bar owner and my friend's band would play there a few weekends a month.
The reason I like Basta's so much is that it's HUGE! And they have really good deals, like 2$ pizzas and 75 cent drafts. 
Honestly this use to be a really good bar when it first opened. But things went down hill real fast. Now a days no one seems to want to go there. It doesn't get nearly as crowded as it once did. The crowd that goes there now has changed.
The cops really watch this place so be careful.

Best thing i've ever seen in my life happened here, though. 
So this girl I knew somehow how got two boy to fight over her. The two boys and their friends broke out into a huge brawl in the parking lot infront of basta's. The people in the parking lot across the street saw the fight and everyone in that parking lot starting beating the crap of each other too. I don't know how it happened but I remeber like 50 dudes just beating the crap out of each other. It was awesome.",-1
"669",1,"We just got back from seeing Fall Out Boy, and I'm so glad we had also seen them at the Cynthia Mitchell Pavilion two days prior, because I did not like this venue at all. 

1. It is way too far from the actual city of Austin to be associated with Austin. We took Uber, and it cost about $40 to reach the venue. At least we didn't have to deal with the parking, because the staff that we did have to deal with were very rude.

2. Ten dollars per beer is just too much. 

3. Ten dollars per beer and having to drink it in the burning sun is way too much. Seriously, haven't they heard of shade in Austin? We got there at 4 p.m. to meet the band and waited two hours in the heat and sun before we got to actually see them. We were pretty ripe. And then afterward there was nowhere to sit unless we wanted to sit in the sun, which I absolutely did not. Finally we found some bleachers and climbed into those and sat on the stairs. My butt is still angry about that.

4. My boyfriend bought a Texas cheesesteak and threw it away, it was so awful.

5. If I pay for front-row seats, I do expect to be in the same zip code as the band when I'm in said seats. Seriously, the pit area is so vast, the seats start about 100 yards away from the stage. I could've dealt with the rest of the negatives, but this was really a deal-breaker for me. I would not go back unless it was absolutely the only choice.",-1
"670",2,"I gave them two stars because TOM and  CHAD have always been very courteous and professional.  When  my son and I dropped off his car this morning to have the tires replaced and the oil changed, service advisor CHRIS  asked if he could take advantage of my son not needing the car back right away. My son, who is 18, said ""no rush.""I, on the other hand, said, ""We need to pack tonight because you're leaving for college tomorrow morning"". It is now 4:50 PM,  CHRIS just called my son and said the car would be ready by 7 PM. I was standing closer to CHRIS than my son was when I said ""We have to pack tonight, you're leaving for school tomorrow"". I don't know what part of that CHRIS did not understand.  When I called CHRIS back, and asked him why it was 7 PM, if he thought that was really reasonable, he said, ""Well, your son said..."", Completely ignoring what I told him. I asked CHRIS if he had college-age children, which he said, ""No."" I asked him if he thought It was reasonable to start packing at 7:30 at night when we got home from picking up  my son's car. He just kept going back to ""Your son said it was no rush"".  I am a reasonable person. We dropped the car off at 8:15 AM, I thought 3 PM would be great, 5 PM would be reasonable. 7 PM IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. I didn't even realize Firestone was open till 7 PM. 

 I honestly don't know why my family keeps going back to Firestone. When we had my daughter's tires put on a few years back, they were bouncing all over the road and the service advisor at that time, told me it was because the steel rims were bent. I said it was because there was 5 to 7 weights on each tire.  It was the 5 to 7 weights. Once we had the tires replaced and re-balanced, We never had a problem with her car again.

When I went in for oil changes, they just didn't rotate the tires when I asked them to. And then when my tires got worn, they said, ""We can't rotate them, we can only replace them now.""

When I was shopping for tires to replace the ones that were not rotated, Firestone's quote for four new tires for my car were more expensive than the dealership.  Everyone knows the dealership is the most expensive. 

I have written maybe two reviews on yelp.  I just don't think it's worth my time to tell people what I think. I am done with Firestone. I will never, ever go back to Firestone, not even to drop off a car.",-1

The couples sitting to either side of me tonight had to yell to talk. My friend and I heard their entire conversations (made easier, of course, because we could not have a conversation at all due to the music and subsequent yelling.)

Update: I heard from the owners personally. She was sincere in her regret and I felt she is really trying to make things right. I sent her an email back and will wait to hear back.

The grits were ice cold, the bacon was greasy, toast was Sahara-dry, the sausage was out of the pack and not very good, the coffee was thin and cold....well, you get the point.

The only (mild) saving grace was the service, which was very good and attentive.

"679",1,"I've been here a few times and I have to say this place has lost it's charm. Changes in the menu, which normally are a good thing has led to the following. One of the most discouraging things is the lack of consistency and misrepresentation of the dishes. One dish that was supposed to contain chicken liver, had none. Another dish which was supposed to have fresh mint with the pasta, had one leaf buried at the bottom and  the sauce tasted like extra left over from another dish. Wine selection is lacking and the wine suggested tasted like sewer run off from France, the wine I picked from the wine menu they didn't have, ""sorry we just ran out""  - that is not the first time I heard this here. I had thought I had found a new standby place, but I was horribly wrong.  I'll just go up the street next time.  

The ambiance can be nice depending where you are seating, and service can be friendly but that too depends on which waiters they have working at that certain time.",-1
"680",2,"I heard great things about Paley's Place, so we decided to give it a try.

The bread was mediocre, to my surprise. Too dry and tough. But I sampled some appetizers on the chef's recommendation and all were flavorful. For my entr├®e, I ordered escargot and bone marrow. The escargot tasted okay, chewy with a sort of vinegar-sauce aftertaste, and I'll admit I've never tasted marrow before so I'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like. (It was rich, fatty, and sticky.) The rabbit ravioli was delicious, with tender meat inside and pasta cooked to perfection. For dessert, I sampled the flan, which was mild and sweet and served with berries. Yum.

Service was excellent throughout the meal. The waitstaff was friendly, patient, and helpful. My friend's sister even got her entr├®e compliments of the chef because ""it didn't come out the way he wanted"".

So, why two stars? Portions were tiny. And by tiny I mean that I could have swallowed my entr├®e in two or three mouthfuls. Yeah, French cuisine prizes quality over quantity. But while the quality was (mostly) there, I also want a meal to satisfy. I'm probably not coming back.",-1
"681",1,"Servers not helpful, they rushing too much. appetizer was ok but the main dish was awful. My wife reject her pizza because it was really bad and have a smell to it. I ordered the chicken parmesan and it came totally different from the picture. However, I ate my plate since I was very hungry. The server took off the charge for my wife pizza but still it was a waste of $65.00 for my kids and me. we had to stop and get a fast sandwich for my wife after we left UNO.  and that didn't feel right.Never again UNO.",-1

They brought us an unopened bottle of wine, which they did not bring us glasses for or open for at least five minutes after the time was given to us.  We got our food over an hour after we had first sat down.  I ordered the Diavola pizza which I was thoroughly disappointed with.  The fresh mozzarella was good, but the dough was so soggy to the point where it resembled more of a waterlogged t-shirt than pizza dough.  Other members of my party ordered normal entrees, only to be brought incredibly small portions considering the steep price.  Overall, not very good.  I recommend just sticking to the North End for Italian.",-1
"685",2,"Regarding sales, the associates at Long's (both Boston and Braintree locations) need to recognize that customers, today, are not only well informed about the product they are interested in purchasing, but also do shop around for best prices.   Amazing what the internet, a phone, and a bit of negotiation can accomplish....., but I digress.

Regarding service, Long's tries to push it's own in-house service center over sending away to the manufacturer.  This, however, I would not recommend. I accepted Long's representation that they were ""authorized"" to repair my watch and it was returned with the date mechanism screwed up (which Long's initially argued was not broke but, really, whoever heard of a date changing at 3:15 a.m. as opposed to 12:00 a.m.?)  Anyway, Long's reluctantly agreed after I pushed back that, yes, there was something wrong and sent it away to the manufacturer to be PROPERLY repaired.   While the watch was eventually repaired, correctly, and I was credited what I initially paid for the repair it required an extra 4 weeks to set right where Long's went wrong.

Long's needs a reality check and come to recognize if not appreciate that in a city as big as Boston (notwithstanding all the available options in the suburbs), that the customer ALWAYS has other options and for every sale Long's looses, another merchant makes.    I know another merchant has my business.",-1
"686",1,"It was a beautiful sunny day and we arrived in granville around noon by aquabus. We were starving and the first restaurant we saw as we walked from the aquabus jetty was Edible Canada. Had heard a lot about this restaurant so we decided to give it a try.

I ordered the ling cod fish n chips, something that many seem to rave about? It came in one of those odd-shaped bowls where the back is high and the front is low. Nice bowl but completely inappropriate to serve fish & chips on as it was virtually impossible to cut the fish. The fish was tasteless and the batter hard like it had been a previously frozen fish that had been baked.

The accompanying asian coleslaw was also bland, had no more than a mouthful. Fries were lukewarm, like they had been under the heatlamp for some time.

The food was lousy but even worse was the service. Our waiter was rude and gave us a sulky face from start to end. We had only received one menu on the way in from the hostess who seated us. Our first encounter with the waiter was when we asked for another menu. He went and got one for us, plopping it on the table without a word spoken.

The food wasn't served to us, it was also just thrown on the table. Our waiter never bothered to come by again to ask us how the food was, or if we needed anything else. When we got the bill, he gave me the credit card slip again without saying a word. No thank you have a nice day please come again. I deliberated whether to tip at all. Maybe giving him nothing would have provoked a conversation. In the end I gave a token 10%.

"695",1,"It pains me to write this review as the restaurant has many fond memories for me; I first discovered The Clay Pit in 1999 when I moved to Austin, and my wife and I frequently went to the restaurant when we were dating. Being Indian and the son of an amazing cook, my standards for Indian food are quite high. And until recently (I'd say the last year or so), The Clay Pit has always lived up to those standards. However, last week I went with my family to celebrate my birthday, and except for the service which was friendly and attentive, everything else fell short. On the cleanliness front, my wife complained of a very messy bathroom that stank of raw sewage, and the table and chairs were covered with a stickiness that required a major scrub down to get clean. Our food was subpar as well. We ordered the vegetable pakora and tandoori vegetables as appetizers. The pakora were over-breaded and cold, the tandoori vegetables consisted mainly of onions and overcooked broccoli. For entrees, we had a rice puloa in which the rice was severely overcooked (mushy to the touch), a malai kofta where the kofta were incredibly dry and dense, and a saag paneer where the saag was clearly old as it was an oxidized dark green / brownish color -- incredibly unappetizing for cooked spinach! The long and the short of the food is that 3 members of our dining party suffered from stomach illness after the dinner!! Sadly, this experience was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back, and my family will not be returning to the restaurant.

Princess Cruises departs from Canada Place for their Alaska bound cruises.  I was here in July and it was chaotic.  I figured it was peak season so I gave this venue some slack.  

I came back here in September for a repositioning cruise to LA.  This place was just as chaotic!  There were 3 cruise ships departing: Golden Princess, and 2 Holland America ships.  If you didn't know better, you'd think you were at Ellis Island.  Thousands of people in line like cattle, speaking every language possible.  

The lines were worse than Disneyland.  It was as far as the eye could see, with the queue wrapped around like a snake.  

-First, they start you at the main room until you get through the TSA / Airport type screening.  

-Then they move you to another room with another line wrapped in 2 different directions for the Customs/ Border Patrol.  

- Just when you think you're done, you have to find the right line for the correct ship.  Lucky Princess had a nice big banner with their logo.  Before you can enter the room the staff gives you a questionnaire about your health.  No pen.  So you search your bag for a pen or pencil to answer a questionnaire if you've been sick, feel sick, have sneezed or vomited, or plan on sneezing or vomiting. I checked No, No, No and NO.

- Hark! I see the end of the line!  Its the Princess Cruise check in!! We give them our boarding pass and the staff member finds our room information and hands us our packet.

Huzzah! We're done, right? Noooo! There's one more line... to board the ship!
Of course, you can't get on the ship without the obligatory photo of the fake cruise backdrop (say bon voyage!)

You finally cliimb the ramp and hand the Princess Cruise personnel your Cruise Card.  They scan it, and take a photo of you (your Cruise Card is your lifeline during the cruise: its your key, your wallet, your ticket on/ off the ship).

The staff here are very courteous and helpful, but we were confused why our room was not functioning properly and why the staff did not bother to fix it even though there were complaints about it before.  I really don't want to give away anything, but basically, there's a box somewhere in one of the rooms and it's obvious that you have to use a certain item to open the box.  We tried several times but it wouldn't open!

Eventually, we just gave up and waited for the game to end.  We then told the staff member that we managed to obtain the item, but could not go any further.  At this point, we were confused because she walked up to that particular box, and started trying to open it.  Guess what?  It didn't work for her either.  After trying 8 or 9 times, the box eventually opened for her, but since we weren't sure ourselves, we had only tried 4 times!  We felt completely ripped off because we wasted so much of our time and if they had made the box properly in the first place, we could have probably gone much further.

While seeing the Knife on 4/28/14, my friend was unfairly and unrightfully ejected from the venue for having courteously held a drink for a person - who was 24 - for a mere few seconds. A security guard mistook this person for a minor, and immediately proceeded to kick them out. Liz. a security guard/ticketer, helped us out by not only EXITING the venue to find my friends, but worked to get them back into the club, and SUCCEEDED. Liz made sure our rights as customers were fulfilled, and looked out for not only our safety but our enjoyment as well, and with a warm and welcoming attitude the entire time. Liz is a shining example of what EVERY employee should be everywhere. A 5 for Liz and a 1 for HOB. So, a 2.",-1
"708",1,"I'm not so sure about this Pita Pit business. I've been a couple times, and each time, I found something to complain about. (I'm easy to please, honestly!)

Maybe I'm completely inept, but I find the menu completely impossible. I usually just end up ordering the only thing I can figure out, which might be why I haven't had the best experiences. It's a cool concept that they prepare the whole thing right in front of you, but I always feel like the ingredients have been sitting in those little bins for a long time. The people preparing the food never really seem 'all there'.. you pick the reason why.

The pitas I've gotten have been alright, nothing to rave about at all. Just plain ingredients in a plain pita, so it tastes, well, plain. Maybe I'll give them another chance when I have 20 extra minutes to decipher their menu, but until then I think I'll take my appetite elsewhere.",-1
"709",2,"I'm so conflicted about Cactus Club. I used to love to hate it, but now I'm running out of love.

The prices have gotten silly. I'd understand if they made the decision to go upscale, but they haven't.  It's elevated pub food.

In terms of this location, they've recently redesigned, and taken away all the cool bits. No more neon non-sequiturs, no more gigantic Lichtenstein-inspired canvas. Nothing quirky. 

The sad part is that I think they're starting to take themselves seriously. That really sucks.",-1

Weeks in advance they used budget on bethel for a truck rental.  1 hour before truck pickup budget called to tell us that they will not have a truck for us.  They didnt even offer a free truck later.  The only thing they said was there was no truck and we are sorry.  Now we can't find a truck anywhere in town on such short notice.  I would never use this location or budget truck rental again.  I will make sure everyone I know hears this story.

"712",2,"I ventured into this established no more than two days ago. The pizza was absolutely delicious. But at a restaurant like this, flavor is just a fragment of success. One of my close friends spilled her water all over the floor. She was embarrassed but it's happened to everyone right? No big deal, it's a simple cleanup. The employees saw the spill and did nothing to help. I was cleaning up with napkins while I waited to get something more absorbent, but it never came. I guess that was a poor expectation on my part. So I went up to one of the servers and asked him for a towel. He looked at me and gave me no response whatsoever. He just walked away. I was actually somewhat shocked by this. I just stood there feeling curious and he came back with a towel, looked at me and threw the towel on the ground, just staring at me, waiting for me to get on my hands and knees and start cleaning. I would have been perfectly happy to clean up the mess, but his attitude was just so appalling. We cleaned it up, but I hope the managerial staff at Pizzicato is going to do some evaluations.",-1
"713",1,"As a Salem local, I was super super excited when I saw that bonchon was opening in salem. Everyone in my life heard about it. Huge fan. I used to travel all the way to Allston and Harvard sq from Salem to get to Bonchon often. Galbi ribs, lychee sake, some of the BEST sushi, other AUTHENTIC Asian items, and of course those delicious wings- I could down like 100 wings to myself. This was my heaven on earth. 

You can understand my disappointment when I arrived at the Salem bonchon to see menu. There was not much variety, but things like a goddamn chicken ceasar wrap and other similar basic stuff etc on the menu. My heart was crushed. I even went several times thinking that maybe it was an off day, maybe I'd like something if I kept trying other things. Unfortunately everything sucked- Like the person cooking didn't know how to cook or something or maybe the food has been out for too long? For example, their signature delicious wings were sooooooo dry af. The chicken meat was like jerky. The staff vibe is really awkward in there too. It's been a while since I've eaten here though. Who knows, it might be different now.",-1

I ordered the 16oz sirloin steak med rare. When it came I was so hungry I just couldn't wait to devour it. It was the most heavily salted/seasoned steak I've ever eaten. I had every one at the table try it, they agreed it was the world's worst $43 steak. The mac n cheese that was paired with it was well well over cooked, and the cheese was burnt. I have been to a lot of major steak houses in Boston, NY, and Miami. I know great steaks, good steaks, and mediocre, this was possibly the worst, I would not tell anyone to eat at this eatery.",-1

We were told we could get a ride to near by restaurants which were only 2 options but because he had another pick up he dropped us off at his closest convince and not the one that was discussed.

We bypassed McCormick and Schmicks because we wanted to try something new. We have been there many times and it is consistently excellent. Not true with Quartet. Our reservation was at 7pm and we were promptly seated. So far so good. I had a delicious wedge salad but my wife chose to just have dinner. About one half hour after my salad was done, my wife had to get up and ask about our dinner. She had lamb chops which were good but her mashed potatoes were not hot. I had the fried shrimp which I could not finish. They were only warm and seemed undercooked.the rice was also just warm. I don't know what the story was because only about five tables had customers. Our waitress offered a free desert but no apologies. She just brought our bill and put it on our table like she was mad at us. This restaurant will not last.

"719",2,"Was out and about with a friend--both of us from out of town. We wanted to do a little dancing and were on the hunt to find a chill spot. After driving by a few clubs and seeing the crowds were pretty much the same every time (white frat boys / asian girls loving techno) we decided we needed a place with a bit more diversity/flavor. We accidentally found Blue Wave and decided to give it a shot. 

The place looked a bit dead on the outside but was not the case inside. The bouncer was cool and let us right in. The coat check girl was anchoring herself to her podium do-hickey looking tired and disinterested...not exactly giving me a fun vibe. We got in and people were dancing so it looked promising. We made our way to the bar and plunked down a boat load of cash for drinks!! I've been to clubs in bigger cities and don't ever remember paying what I paid for a long island ice tea there! That being said all the drinks were slap your mama strong! I mean it. No watered down anything here! 

Overall the music was...eh...could have been better. Initially a little reggae which I'm not really into. Then it went to hip hop from the 80's, 90's and today with a smidgen of R&B thrown in. 

The crowd was mostly black but I did see a few white guys and girls there. Mostly older couples at first and then more single guys came in. 

Everyone was very well dressed so it was nice to see people looking good. Not sure about the ""no flats allowed policy"" -my friend had flats on and had no problem getting in. 

The place is only getting 2 stars from me because I really thought they could have mixed the music up a little better. But the real reason is the crowd. The place did not give off a pretentious vibe but I have to say the people there were not very friendly. I thought it had to do with the amount of couples that were there but then when the influx of single guys came in-I thought it was odd that a lot of these guys still seemed standoffish. Another girl came and sat at the bar and just held her purse and looked like she couldn't be bothered to talk to anyone. 

On our way out -my friend mentioned how rude the crowd got after almost running her over to get their coats from the coat check. 

We did end up talking to this woman outside of the club who was very friendly (maybe a little drunk too) who was hoping we had a good time. 

All in all, it was ok for a little something to do but the crowd sank it for me. 

So not sure what that was about. Maybe we came on an off nite?

"720",2,"I moved to the area 3 years ago, found this bbq spot and fell in love! I really appreciated the authentic bbq taste and southern hospitality. Due to heavy work travel I haven't been able to enjoy my favorite bbq spot. So, I decided to visit and order the same ole chicken dinner, to only find that they no longer served chicken with bone...WHAT? The only types of chicken thats available is Sliced or Chopped- That's IT! I was told, it wasn't popular...which is hard to believe- it's chicken!  

So, I ordered sliced chicken...the food was good but I noticed they scaled back on the portion sizes. Overall, I like the place but I'm going to look for alternative bbq spots with bone in chicken. Btw, I don't eat beef or pork... so my options are limited.",-1
"721",2,"Kinda creepy, really.

Why is it that it seems like customers aren't really, like, WELCOME at strip clubs?  Or am I  just super creepy?  See I don't want a creepy complex from somewhere as COMPLETELY creepy as the Safari Show Club.  I don't think I'm creepy.  Gawd.

Here's a visual for you.  There is only one guy sitting at the meat rail.  A, shall we say, carefree, creative, substantially overweight gal with Lee Press On Hair and  cottage cheese thighs worse than my own reaches her airbrushed talons into the guy's empty rocks glass and helps herself to some of his mini-ice cubes.....You know what. I'm not even going to finish this part. Let your mind land where it does here and that's exactly how it panned out.  Ewe. Ewe. Ewe.....

A lot of melted ice ended up on the floor so the next dancer's set consisted entirely of her lethargically pushing a dishtowel around on the floor with as much grace as my elementary school janitor. 
 
But for a creepy finale, the guy has this inaudible diaglogue with his server which I assumed to be:

Creepy Guy: ""Can I get another (""free"") drink here. The creepy stripper put her airbrushed talons in it.""

Waitress: ""No. Your drink was gone sir.""

Creepy Guy: ""No it wasn't. Look. There's more there."" (Gestures to quarter inch of melted ice with ever-so-slight-whiskey coloration).

Waitress: ""Here."" (Waitress throws a straw in the glass of melting ice and sashays off.  Creepy Guy finishes ice drippings.)

"723",1,"There are tons of sushi restaurants in Vancouver, ranging from high quality to low quality, and everything in between. Unfortunately, IMO Sushi Maki is on the lower end of that scale. 

Having been here a few times now, the experience is always the same: open the door to a nearly empty/dead quiet restaurant with no background music... only to be met by the woman owner/employee barking at you ""HERE OR TO GO?!!!"" in a thick Chinese-English accent.

Gee, what a nice way to greet your customer(s), it feels so hospitable and welcoming to have the first thing yelled out of the host's mouth be ""HERE OR TO GO?!!!"", instead of ""Welcome to Sushi Maki, how are you this evening?"" or something along those lines.

Anyway, I digress. On this most recent visit I entered the nearly empty restaurant, got barked at with HERE OR TO GO, said TO GO, placed my order and paid, and then took a seat and waited for my order of 8 Teriyaki Beef Sushi Rolls. 

While waiting, I hear the woman employee constantly arguing in Chinese with the sushi ""chef"" (who I assume is her husband). They bickered back and forth for well over 20 minutes, while I was waiting patiently for an order of 8 teriyaki beef rolls. Does it really take that long to make 8 teriyaki beef rolls, especially when there were only 2 other guests in the restaurant?

After nearly 30 minutes I was about ready to ask for a refund and leave, but as I was about to get up the chef saunters over with the takeout container of beef rolls and tosses it on the table where I was waiting. No mention of ""here you go, sorry for the wait"" or anything of the sort. I said ""thanks"" but didn't even get a response, as he made his way back to the kitchen. WTF?

Needless to say I wasn't impressed with the service here -- slow, rude, arguing staff/owners, and not even authentic Japanese staff. The whole place just feels very uncomfortable, like you're in the middle of some family argument the whole time.

So I leave the restaurant and start eating my Teriyaki beef rolls on the way home -- instead of being worth the wait, they were disgusting. Gristly, fatty, dried out strips of teriyaki beef in a sushi roll that fell apart immediately, and which was bland and tasteless. 

THIS is the garbage food I waited 30 minutes for? What a F'ing joke. I was really pissed off, after all that BS at the restaurant, only to be served crap food. 

Bottom line -- I won't be going back, and I suggest you don't either. The sushi place literally next door to this one (while a bit pricier) is far higher quality in taste and ingredients, and is actually authentically Japanese, so I'm not sure how Sushi Maki stays in business... but considering the competition in this city, they have a lot to learn when it comes to making proper sushi and even more so on restaurant hosting/etiquette to provide a welcoming environment/experience for guests. 

They score poorly on all fronts in this regard, so they get 1 star from me. Adios Sushi Maki, you've just lost a customer for good!",-1

It's not that the sushi wasn't tasty, it just wasn't anything special. I enjoyed the deal of the 2-combination sushi with miso soup and a salad and the price was certainly fine. My boy ordered the orange chicken, which was also delicious, but nothing really exceptional. 

I will say that the service was just terrible. It took forever for us to even get our glasses of water and then we had to wonder about our waiter's attitude, which seemed on the surly side.

"730",2,"I really hoped that I would like this place.  I really liked Vinny's but don't go out looking for Italian very often.  So I was excited to see that they had changed to a sports bar and grill type feel.  The atomosphere is good, nice patio, TVs everywhere.  Lots of space.  First impression good.  The server was very friendly and seemed knowledgable about the menu and recommended some of her favorites.  The chips and hot sauce came out and it was very good, so second impression was good too.   The waitress RAVED about the mojitos so we ordered two (watermelon) sounded refreshing and at $8 each better be.  They were nothing special and actually very watered down.  Not impressed at all.  And kind of upset that I had to pay that much.  
Next the waitress had told us how great the hamburgers are and how spicy the Chulu burger was.  I love spicy so I am excited to try it.  We also ordered the gorgonzola and red pepper burger.  These burgers had absolutely NO taste.  How can this be?  A pepper crusted burger with pepper jack cheese and fried jalapenos and nothing, no kick like it promised only grease.   The red peppers on the other burger had some flavor but not much.  The parmesean fries were also rather flavorless.  SO DISAPPOINTED and perplexed how did they take all the flavor out?

Bought tickets and was told that wife and I would have to attend presentation on times share to get while discount.  Ok no problem.  Except that at time of booking was told presentation was at 730.  Everything was confirmed at time of sale. Was waiting on email which I wasn't getting.  Took 3 calls each at least 30 minutes to finally be told that ""oops"" that the 730 presentation was no longer available. It had to be 1030 which would completely be a wasted day at Disney. I spoke with manager who kindly said ""well you just won't get your full discount if you don't come to the presentation. After much expressions of disapproval I chose my family over the discount.  

Now day comes to get tickets from this so called resort.  First I called for directions and the girl could not even tell me the exit number off I4. Knew we were in trouble at this point.  Her suggestion was to just add address to gps in car. Thanks for the no clue service.  

Finally fund the place.  Go in to be greeted by a line of people.  Finally get to the person who can direct us to our tickets.  Another oops we can't find the record of you purchase.

"746",1,"First of all, this is hardly Lebanese food. I went in looking forward to eating something that reminds me of home, but was really disappointed. I went online first to check the menu and thought it was weird there were traditionally Greek foods listed as well as the ""Lebanese"" food. I was going to pick up dinner for my family so I had a list. 
I went in and was very thrown off. The menu inside had maybe half of what's listed online. I said whatever and tried to give this one place a chance I started my order with a Saj wrap and I knew I was in for trouble when the man taking my order didn't even know what I was talking about. Once he figured it out it didn't get any better he didn't know how to wrap it up and it just fell apart when I went to eat it. I then asked for a couple orders of Kibbeh, and at that moment I knew I was giving up on my order. The gentleman taking my order said ""what? I don't know what that is. Can you tell me what that is?"" And once I described it to him he asked if I wanted it in a rice bowl or wrap. I said can't I just do an order of just kibbeh? Then the manager came out at this moment and so I asked him and he said ""oh we are out and are getting a shipment of food tomorrow."" My take from this was that the actual Lebanese food they did have wasn't fresh and therefore probably not that good.

I am not sure how small this place is, but I can't even swallow this an reschedule my appointment. I've brought groupon, so even though this is not in my neighborhood, I would still travel from South Boston give it a try. Today I was my 3rd time rescheduling this appointment in the last 3 months. On a typical friday afternoon, there's traffic. I call them half way when I know I was late the lady on the phone told me to reschedule it and come again some other time. I assume this is a super tiny store? No other employees could help even a walk in? No one wants any extra customers in her store? I am afraid to try going again wasting my gas. I'll never going back again, and I would tell you should never go. This nail salon is un-recommanded!",-1

When the pizza arrived the flavor was ok, crust was tough and it was um warmish? I was feeling better once I a little food in my belly until I open the salad, creamy Italian...we ordered champagne vinaigrette.

"751",1,"This was my first time eating here (after hearing a lot about their grilled pork spring rolls-which tasted pretty good but looked as if it was wrapped up by a 5 year old). Coming from a Vietnamese origin and having been pampered with AMAZING Vietnamese food in Houston, this place was quite a let down for me. I have never dealt with rude service at a Vietnamese restaurant before until this visit. I always get Bun Bo Hue at Pho places. My bowl came out and the broth was clear (bun bo hue's broth is kinda murky with red oils). I was hesitant to taste but I did. The broth might has well have been tap water. The bowl had an abundance of meats and noodles though. I asked for shrimp paste and chili oil (which is regularly served with the dish). She asked if I really needed it and insisted on me retasting my soup.I did just to appease and still put in the request. 5 mins later she comes back with only the shrimp paste and I asked for the chili. She left to retrieve it and asked if I needed anything else (as if my requests were out of this world). Its safe to say this will be my first and last time here. I could have turned the other way with the rude service (she could have had a bad day) but there is no excuse for flavorless food.",-1

"753",1,"This review is in regards to my experience with Oak + Fort's online website, more specifically, their Customer Care department. I can sum it up in one word: nonexistent. I purchased a gift voucher online as a gift for my bridesmaid back on August 31st. I would have purchased it in person at their downtown Vancouver location, but as I had been busy with my wedding and I had flown in from out of town that week, I simply did not have the time. I thought I had saved myself so much time and effort by purchasing a gift certificate online. I couldn't have been more wrong.

They only accepted PayPal for payment, which wasn't a problem. I received the receipt for my payment right away, but it wasn't until September 9th (more than a week later) that I received an email from a Stephanie from Customer Care confirming who she was to send the voucher to. I responded on the same day, requesting that she send the voucher to my email address so that I could then forward it to its recipient. I never heard from anyone again. I sent another email on September 12 (nothing), and on September 17th I told them that if I didn't hear from them by the end of the week, I would file a dispute with PayPal to get my money back. Throughout this time, I attempted to phone Customer Care (no one responded) to deal with this issue. I also made sure that the gift voucher did not get lost in my (and the gift card's recipient's) email spam folder. I finally got so fed up, I went ahead and filed a dispute with PayPal on September 20th. One week later, Oak + Fort had still not responded to the dispute, so I escalated the dispute to a claim to get my money back.

It's a shame I've had such a horrible experience with Oak + Fort because I really am a fan of their clothing and aesthetic, along with their sister company, Loft82. But for a company with a continuously growing online presence (Facebook, Instagram), it's  frankly pathetic how bad their customer service department is. I even tried writing on their Facebook page in the hopes that SOMEONE would see and respond. It's unbelievable that they have no problems updating their Instagram and Facebook accounts daily, but no one can even be bothered to respond to messages in their Customer Care department. Even more, for something as simple as purchasing an online gift card where it is to be received by email (and not even through regular mail), it's inexcusable that it's taken this long without a reply. It's been over a month, and as of today I still have not heard a single word from the company since September 9th. I will provide an update if I ever end up hearing from them to see how they handle the situation.",-1

"755",1,"Belligerent bartenders were the hallmark of my experience...  Although, I also witnessed their security company (M&B Security, owned by Matt Elzie) assault someone on my way out.  Two of their employees placed a patron in a headlock and DRAGGED him out of the place with his body flailing like deadweight behind him.  It appeared to have been completely unprovoked, and was actually quite disturbing - if you thought the United Airlines incident was bad, you should have seen this.  A lawsuit is almost certain to come this place's way if they keep this up, and retain this security company.

I'm not so much complaining to potential customers but really trying to tell Mears execs to respectfully get a clue. This is a horrific experience. You need to improve your operations and efficiency. A 5th grader could improve this system. I can't imagine there are enough people in the world that come here for the first time and use your service. I'm confident you have zero repeat customers.

The coffee is really good. So good that I'm trying to decide if I can overlook the poor service.  I have been here 3 times and each time I walk in, approach the register. Some barista is behind the counter busily constructing a drink or heating up a quiche. Maybe they look up, maybe they don't, but the definitely don't SAY anything.  So I stand there awkwardly waiting to be helped.  When they approach the register they say very little, if anything. They quietly make my drink, put it up on the counter, without a word. I'm just guessing it's mine so I take it, it's delicious. I leave still contemplating if the coffee is good enough for another go around with the shitty staff.  

Even if you are busy a ""hi"" or ""i'll be right with you"" goes a long way, but honestly, I've never been in there when they are busy.  I may go back to Aurora where the coffee is good enough, everyone is friendly, the wifi doesn't require a pass and everything feels alright.",-1

After I dropped off the unopened bottles, I received NO documentation of the return I made, and after contacting the company repeatedly I gave up.  Months later, an invoice for the full amount showed up.  Again, I called and emailed and two weeks later was able to get everything straightened out--they had a record of the return, it just had somehow never gotten to me.  I thought.

the food comes before the bread.  the meals were decent.  i got a goat dish with bangledeshi spices and rice and my friend got a shrimp dish with coconut milk.  mine was fairly spicy but tolerable.  i liked the rice that it came with.  there was some raw onion pieces on the dish that i wasn't sure what to do with so i just avoided it really.  my friend said her dish was okay but that her shrimp had some gritty taste on it.

"794",2,"I got french tip UV nails and they turned out okay. Kind of a sloppy job, left many spots uncovered and bubbles. The place smells really strong of nail polish, and the nail artist was kind of rude, she tried persuading me into getting something I didn't want so be careful with that. My nails were left way too short, the acrylic falling off my nail and really wide. I had called in about how much the nails were going to be an they said 20, but when I got there it turned out to be 35, I got nothing extra so I was pretty annoyed by that. My friend came and got her nails done also and her nail artist was really sweet but didn't do a good job either. I will never go back, not worth the 35$ at all.",-1

I will pass on the deserts which disappointed me even more, especially when french have such a wide variety of desert such as cakes, and patisserie! and for a total of $ 250 for 3 ...",-1
"797",1,"My cousin was visiting from California and really wanted to visit Red Lobster, since they don't have them out West.  She said she missed the Cheddar Bay Biscuits.

The biscuits never disappoint, but the rest of the meal certainly did.

I ordered the Hand-Battered Fish and Chips, and I could have used the fish as a door stop, it was so over-cooked.  The battered part was totally inedible, and the fish I managed to scrape out of it was dry and chewy.  

My cousin ordered the Ultimate Feast, and while she said the lobster tail and crab legs were ""okay"", she had the same over-cooked/over-fried issue with her shrimp, and found it completely inedible, describing it as ""horrible"".  

When we complained to our server, the only offer was to bring us new dishes, but we both said ""no thanks!"" and asked for a dozen biscuits to go at no charge, which they complied with.  

The reputation of Red Lobster has really suffered over the years, and with this experience I can see why.  It's such as shame as this was once one of my favorite restaurants.",-1
"798",2,"I scheduled an appointment with Dr. Bendall to get sedatives for my cats. Dr. Bendall got back to me by e-mail to confirm everything. However, a couple days later I hear from Jayne an assistant of his. She told me that Dr. Bendall didn't service my area. I thought it was crazy because I live in the Circle C area and my husband and I were willing to pay the extended area fee.  So she recommended other vets to me.

HOWEVER... frozen vegetables (and completely devoid of any flavor), ""pulled"" pork that was as tough as leather and could not possibly have been cooked the same day (I'd guess several days earlier). Both of these problems are absolutely unacceptable at any restaurant. Went there on a Living Social deal, so they must be having trouble, not surprisingly. I should start reading reviews before buying these deals. Hope this prevents someone from a huge disappointment.",-1
"800",2,"Like most others, you have great anticipation at this place because it is so cozy looking.  Its not a huge let down, but I'd rather stay home and cook my own bowl of pasta and open a nice bottle of wine.  

The service was quite good, very prompt and friendly.  We shared a bottle of Pinot Noir and each had a pasta entree.  It has one of those menus that is just too large for anything to be really that good.  Plus, it takes forever to make a decision on what to have.  The portions are a good size, but the food was just okay.  This place is perfect for what it is; grab a bite to eat after a movie.  It is located right next to Fifth Ave Cinema.",-1

"802",2,"The food wasn't bad, but I feel really ripped off.  I glanced and the menu and decided on a capri salad, which sounded nice and light. This dish is simple (tomato, moz. and basil with a little balsamic reduction) and very hard to mess up, so it didn't fail on taste, but I didn't pay enough attention to the prices and consequently got ripped off. It cost 9.95 and consisted of three slices of tomato with toppings. I felt like they could have at least given me a whole tomato for ten bucks. The staff was attentive, but also had their own hangout happening. It was a decent atmosphere, but i can't go back after being robbed like that.",-1

We each had different salads (she had a Greek & I had a dinner salad) and it was a big bowl of lettuce with a few pieces of carrot shavings, one small wedge of a piece of tomato some flakes of red cabbage and a small cup of dressing.  BORING!!!  Come on.....this is one step above a McDonald's.  The Greek salad was not much more exciting...chincy on everything but the lettuce.  

The dessert was ok....A brownie w/ scoop of vanilla ice cream w/ hot fudge on it.  Brownie was a bit hard to break w/ a fork but we weren't expecting too much from it after the salads.

"806",2,"I'm convinced that Forever 21 SUCKS! I've been to a few and can never find ANYTHING! I don't know what it is but I don't like this store. However, a few days ago I decided to walk in here to see if I could find a cute black pea coat. To my surprise, I found one that I love! I had an associate put it on hold because I wanted to walk to a few other stores to make sure I didn't see anything I liked better. I wanted to compare styles, quality & prices, you know how us women are.

So, when I got back a new girl was in the fitting room (that's where they hold items). I told her I had a jacket on hold. She wasn't friendly at all, you could tell she didn't want to be there. She goes and supposedly looks for it but can't find it. And that's it, no oh I'm so sorry let me help you find it or get someone to help you find it, none of that. And that was the last one left! So I went to the check-out counter and complained. One of the girls went back to the fitting room and found it for me, so why couldn't the other dumb girl find it? I'm just glad they found it because I was about to go off, I really wanted it and I had just put it on hold maybe 30 minutes ago, if that.

Also, the customer service sucks at this location as you can see. When I first walked in all the ""black"" girls just stared at me. Yes, I'm beautiful and this beautiful girl needs some assistance. WTF?! I didn't get a ""Hello, how are you today?"" or ""Do you need any assistance?"" What is up with the people they hire?! SMH! It was a Wednesday afternoon so of course it was super dead in there but they had a million workers staffed. So you mean to tell me you have almost 10 workers on this one floor (they have two floors), you're not busy and no one has said a word to me? Get the hell out of here! The only nice girl was the young lady who put my coat on hold.

I will probably never go into this store again. I just happened to get lucky finding this nice coat. It's actually just as nice as my brown pea coat from Nordstroms but like $200 cheaper and a little shorter. The only reason I'm giving it 2* is because I did find something I really like and since the fitting room attendant was nice.",-1

However, I did notice that my left eyebrow area was a little more irritated than usual, but I figured it would go away in about an hour. I actually pre-booked an appointment for 3 weeks later because I was very happy with how my wax looked. 

Unfortunately, the irritation only got worse and it turns out that some of my skin was actually ripped off during the wax. Today (about 16 hours after my wax), the entire area under my brow is completely red and painful. I called European Wax Center, and all they did was ask me to come back in so they could look at the area under my brow and see if there were any products they could give me. I don't want products - I want the skin under my eyebrow back.

The wooden play structure was swarming with 5-year-olds wearing T-shirts identifying them as part of the Bev Rec Tiny Tots program. They were essentially unsupervised; the adults with matching shirts were in a corner gabbing. The bigger kids pushed my 2-year-old down, refused to stop climbing up the slide so my child could go down, and in general made it miserable to try to supervise my own child.

"819",1,"Worst Customer Service EVER!

I had really wanted to write a review of the Matchstick Cafe which gave them high marks for their incredible baked goods and their nice interior, but customer service is really important to me, and that's why they're only getting one star. 

I'll relay my most recent experience and why I'll likely not return: I was out running errands one afternoon last week, and though I wasn't in the neighbourhood, I decided to take a detour to Matchstick because I was really craving one of their double-baked almond croissants (a past favourite of mine). As I entered and approached the display case, I was initially disappointed because it looked as though they had completely sold out of croissants - bummer! - but was then very excited to see a whole tray of them sitting out for all to see on the counter behind the case. At this point, I happily asked the guy at the point of sale terminal for one of the croissants and was completely floored by his reply, ""You can't have one, those are for tomorrow"". 

I told him that I had made a special trip to Matchstick for one of those croissants (that were sitting right there staring at me!) and all I got was another ""You can't have one, those are for tomorrow"". I then tried to appeal to his logical sensibilities by explaining that I was a paying customer here right now, looking at the croissants right there, and that whether they sold one today or tomorrow, it really didn't matter. He just kept annoyingly repeating his mantra of ""You can't have one, those are for tomorrow"" and then walked away leaving me alone at the till. 

At that point I was understandably fuming at this pedantic, ""those are the rules"" attitude. Firstly, the guy was refusing a potential paying customer - and for no real reason. Secondly, would it have really killed the guy to be nice to someone who had made a special trip to his store? Thirdly, don't keep the baked goods out on the counter where everyone can see them if you don't intend to sell them - it's pretty simple!

So, in the end, what did this ""those are for tomorrow"" rule accomplish? I have since found another place with equally fantastic baked goods and much friendlier, less pretentious staff - something I wouldn't have looked for otherwise. My husband, who often stopped at Matchstick on his way to work (but had had his own negative customer service experiences) figured this was the final nail in the coffin for him and likely won't go back. I've also been telling a lot of friends about this experience and they aren't impressed either.

And, it compelled me to leave this less-than-impressed review!",-1

It was a little overpriced, the decor and dinnerware was a very tacky 1970s theme, and I expected more taps from a tavern. The food was AOK, but nothing stood out as delicious.

My husband and I, dejected from our free concert during SXSW fail, headed over for a late lunch. We shared the biscuit and cheese tots, I got a burger and he a pulled rib sandwich. The tots were not what you'd expect (in that they looked like mini egg rolls and were filled rather than topped by the brisket and cheese), and I think the individual parts were better than the combined result. There were about 8 taps, a mixture of local and big breweries. The burger was juicy and the fries were crispy at least!

The sandwiches came out on wooden cheese board, and they looked like the restaurant had a hard time getting them clean. The salad bowls looked like parquet flooring, and my fries were in a ridiculous tin.

All told, no red flags but nothing that impressed me either.",-1

"825",2,"They're nice enough here, and they sell some nice looking furniture, but i question the quality.  Years ago I purchased a leather sectional couch here for approx $4,000.  (Perhaps their quality has improved in recent years?).  It lasted about 2 years before i went to sit down and as i did, I heard a loud ""snap"" (i'm not a large or heavy person) and a piece of the frame clearly broke.  The couch cushion in that area immediately started sagging.  Luckily it was under warranty.  I called and the company sent out a rep to examine the couch. He didn't even flip the piece over to feel the obviously broken piece of wood frame poking through the bottom (which i later found to be cheap particle board and not suitable for furniture). He told me it was sagging because i always sat in that same spot and it wore this way over time, which is absolutely not true.  (And even if it was true, a couch is meant to be sat upon and for $4,000, it should last more than a couple of years).  So the 5 year warranty was totally useless.  I got a quote to have it repaired and it was actually cheaper just to buy a new couch.  This may not be Dania's fault, but they should sell better quality furniture for the prices they charge--or stand behind them.  I loved this couch, while it lasted.  Buyer beware.",-1

"827",1,"Updated...so, this place has turned out to be a nightmare. Still impressed with Dorothy, but management here is absolutely clueless about how to treat customers. I always have 5-7 units, running over $1,000/ month, yet new customers off of the street get better rates on additional units than I do adding additional ones when needed for my business inventory. They post banners about $1 first month, but this only applies to your first unit at a Public Storage. On top of rates that are posted, they get you for buying a special lock that no other storage facility uses, so ridiculous waste of money, especially if you have your own locks, which I did...then also charge $22 admin fee per unit...and insurance, so price ends up more than initially comparing with prices elsewhere. Also, I run a hectic business and have storage in place so I don't have constant hassles, yet they call constantly about stupidity. I left a completely empty unit open as I had a shipper running late due to truck problems & as I had several appointments, left unit open in case I personally would not be meeting him. Only have my set of keys & one other, but didn't know who would be running to meet him when he got his truck fixed. I received several calls telling me that they would be putting their lock on( which I or my employees would not be able to open ) as not allowed to leave open even though empty...crazy hassle when I was already juggling to try to cover the issue. Explained to Dorothy the situation & she insisted management would not allow it, then management called me, complete idiot with insane rules. Tired of jumping hoops, checking out carts unlike other places that have them out, parking lot is a small lot which becomes unworkable as soon as two trucks are there & of course often more there. Large front doors, but narrow doors inside that require extra person to hold while two others have to maneuver furniture sideways, etc trying to fit large pieces through stupidly small door...reserve a unit online & you will receive an insane amount of calls bugging you to come in. Online allows reserving for a few days, but reality is that you will be threatened with losing it if you don't rush in. Have never been so hassled by inane details like this. I give up, phasing out with them. I had nice clean inventory & always paid bills, hope they enjoy having nasty bedbug junk in them instead from people that move in:) Like other climate controlled places, nothing keeps rats & vermin from running from one unit to another...

My previous review when I first moved in...
--------------------------------------------------
Yes, Dorothy helped me & is a wonderful person to work with! Wish the free first month posted applied to all units as I rented several:) Also, be sure to book online rather than just see the rates online & go in as rates higher if you wait until you get there...kind of tricky with getting best rates. Door is not automatic as you go in & out with furniture, so you have to stop & punch in code each & everytime you go in & out with furniture, which is especially frustrating if you are by yourself. Hopefully, they will remedy this difficulty soon. Also, carts must be checked in & out, rather than  being in hall ready to go. Again, hope this policy changes. Staff is very pleasant though, so hanging in there due to that:) that counts for a lot!! Hopefully, since they are smart about who they hire, the other opening day glitches will be fixed.",-1

My futomaki was gross...it had some weird onion-y pickled thing which I have never encountered before.  The cali roll was pretty good but the avocado roll had about as much flavor as paper.

The people here aren't that nice either, at least the several times I have been here.. Not the clientele, not the staff. When it is busy, the wait for ordering a drink was so long I just went ahead and ordered two beers.

I also take issue with the beer selection. No craft beer on tap and only a couple in bottles just doesn't do it for me. I'm sure you can get all the domestic and liquor that your heart desires so this might not be an issue for everyone. I find the layout of Tequila Cowboy to be perplexing. Stairs in odd places, lots of hallways and turns, things both upstairs and down. I am never quite sure where to go. One thing is for sure though, it is LOUD no matter where you go. With the music and karaoke bar, really the only place to have conversation would be outside on the patio. Be prepared for smokers there. The bathrooms are tucked away in a corner and once they actually had an attendant there, so bring some small bills for tipping.

I tried the food once. It was ok. Not much more to say about that. Pretty standard bar fare potato skins. For upsides, the bands are usually pretty good.

Given the prices for entrees, this seems to be extremely cheap and shortsighted by the owners!   I ordered the carnitas enchiladas which came with a chipotle salsa.  The food came out lukewarm (even the beans and rice were room temperature) which is an issue that needs to be addressed.  While the beans and rice were both bland and forgettable, the enchiladas had tender pork with a delicious (and quite spicy) chipotle sauce.

They offer three simple meat choices, which I got on their doubly wrapped corn tortilla.  The beef bulgogi is the best of the lot, and is much sweeter than bulgogi you may have had elsewhere.  There is not enough spicy flavor for me though.  The chicken lemon grass had a sweet mild flavor that was completely overpowered by the mountain of greens on the taco.  Finally the garlic fish was just OK.

Overall there just isn't enough special about the tacos to justify coming back here when you have Torchys and Tacodeli as North Austin alternatives.",-1
"839",1,"Absolutely disgusting service provided from the owner herself. We had to beg to be served. I asked her for a special request and it was completely ignored and she clearly heard me in Korean.
We had to call out for help 3 times to finally get acknowledged. Then she purposely found more things to do before bringing us stale tea. (she has not once came to ask how the food was, or if we needed anything until we called her 3 times when we were done our meal and throats dry as sand) Even though they are open till 10pm last call is at 8:45 and the bloated owner demands you to only order simple and quick orders.",-1

"843",1,"Could not have been worse! Not accommodating. Had a group of 5 needed an extra chair for happy hour. Was told there was no way to accommodate us.  The front desk simply stood there while I was trying to ask if there was anyway that we would be able to have a couple items off the bar menu in the dinning room.  All that we wanted is to be able to sit together.  I called the manager that pretty much told me ""too bad"".  We have been there for about every birthday and anniversary, we wanted to show people what were talking about.  I don't know if it was because we aren't older, but we have just as much disposable income as the rest.  It was the end of happy hour, we were going to get the lobster claws then order a steak.  

We ended up getting a good meal that night, it just happened to be at across the street that made sure we had a place to sit.  I think that was the last time we will eat there, especially after a call to the manager just yielded that 'should have come earlier""",-1

Finally, when I received my check, they charged dinner pricing for a lunch. I was running late to get back to the office, so I paid it, but all said, the service was inexcusable.

"851",1,"I was so disappointed with this restaurant. My boyfriend, dad, and I arrived at 7:00  PM on a rainy Monday evening. When we walked in, no one greeted us at all until I asked a server if we could sit anywhere. She said someone would be with us shortly. 5 mins after just awkwardly standing around, we were told there was a 15 minute wait (although I counted 4 empty tables). When we were finally seated, a server came and didn't introduce himself but started filling our glasses with water and removing plates from the table. Our ""real"" server finally came and although he greeted us with no smile he did tell us his name! We quickly ordered food and appetizers since we had already been waiting for a while but lo and behold we had to wait 30 minutes for our hummus appetizer (after having to remind another server for it). I was tempted to ask for an apron to put my own hummus on the plate... When we finally got our food (2 minutes after the appetizer came) my boyfriend began to cut into his supposedly medium-rare venison burger while my dad and I snuck fries off the plate. Our server comes up with another burger plate and informs us that we are in fact cutting into someone else's burger. I explained to him that we had already cut the burger and were eating fries off the plate and he said that's OK we'll take care of it. I expected him to leave us the wrong burger since we had already begun to eat off of the plate but he said that they would just switch the bun. I told him again that we had already eaten off the plate and he said that's OK and took the burger away. We cut into the second burger and it was well-done unfortunately. My brussels sprouts were swimming in oil, but the capers were a nice addition. My dad got the venison pizza which was OK but pretty devoid of any flavor. Our server came over at the end and never asked us how our food was and never smiled (ever) and we were left feeling slightly full but mostly disappointed.",-1

I ordered a coffee and it never arrived. My friend wanted coconut chutney with his meal but it wasn't served, and there wasn't a large selection at the buffet. The rice was over cooked.

"854",1,"I placed an order with the Pizza Hut on Buford Highway in Atlanta for a Large pan pizza with a pretzel crust and various meat toppings. A medium regular crust pizza with meats that were not ordered arrived. I contacted the store and asked to have the correct order sent out. Over an hour passed and the correct pizza had not arrived. I called back and no one answered so I contacted Pizza Hut corporate customer service and the customer service agent was unable to assist in any way. I asked for a refund and she told me to contact the store. When I informed her they were not picking up there she told me to drive to the store. I am at work and do not have the time to drive several miles in Atlanta traffic to deal with this. I was finally able to contact the store in regards to the pizza and he stated that the delivery driver who was bringing our order had several other deliveries to do first and would get to our order. I requested a refund and the person who answered the phone said he would process the refund within 5-7 days then simply hung up. I will not be ordering from Pizza Hut again. This is hands down the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced from a pizza delivery place. Papa John's pizza may not be quite as good but at least they send the correct pizza and do not hang up if there is an issue.",-1

The women was nice enough to go check, they only had 2 pairs in my size and unfortunately not the right style which I politely told her. However, as soon, I said that and before I could even ask another question she just hung up the phone on me. Duh! Not only was it incredibly rude, but actually kind of stupid. Although, they may not have had something that worked for me, I am getting married, that means I could have members of my wedding party that need to purchase things, but instead of practicing good customer service she just hung up.

"856",1,"COLLEGE PARENTS BEWARE....They will try the bait and switch. I received the WORST Customer Service EVER! It stinks that Comcast is the only game in town. 

There is usually a flyer circulating during move-in for the ""Student Bundle"". They offer a discounted price if you use two or more services. My daughter needs Cable Internet & TV. FYI, the ""bundled"" price for  those two services in Brookline is $69.99 for service + $7.00 for modem rental per month. Prices good for 9 months, which covers the school year.

But it took 5 phone calls for me to end up with that price. My first quote was $74.99, going up to $109.00 after 6 months. When I tried to schedule installation, I was told that there was mistake and it was no longer available at that price for her address, that it would be $109 per month. I called back to talk to a supervisor (Shawn in Florida, who was NO help). He said he could offer me the price of $79.99 and for me to call back within the month to see what the NEW promotion was and I could switch at that time. 

Somehow, I finally got to customer service in Boston and spoke with a very helpful lady and fellow Sox fan. She informed me I had not been offered the ""Student Bundle"" and quickly corrected the problem and scheduled my daughter's installation without switching me to the incompetent installation department. Sorry to say, her great assistance is the only reason I'm giving them 1 star.",-1

We had to wait at least 30 minutes for our curries to arrive and there was no white rice for my husband.  How does a Thai restaurant run out of white rice?  During peak dinner service at 7pm?  We had ordered sushi as an appetizer but since it didn't arrive by the time our curries arrived we cancelled the sushi.  For some reason they still brought us the sushi 20 minutes later and we sent it back.

The green curry with tofu was good but was missing the green beans and my husband's chicken panang was very tasty.  If we decide to give them another try I'm looking forward to attempting to order the sushi again.

The food was good (well, what we received was good) but the service was lousy.  Management needs to put some sense of organization into the operation.  It seemed like everyone was running around with no purpose and no direction.  I hope they can pull it together because our curries were quite good and we'd like to give them another try.",-1

I've been dying to try this place since I moved to the area and convinced my friends to meet me there for dinner the other night. I took the redline to Porter, got off and loaded up Yelp on my phone to figure out where this place was. 

Yelp says that it's at 1815 Mass Ave and shows it on a map as being down by Prentiss Street so I braved the cold and walked down Mass Ave looking for it. I made it about half a mile before deciding that I wasn't going to find it and backtracked. At this point I see the Porter Exchange and a bunch of people walking out the door with to-go bags that covered in Japanese writing. I decide that it's worth a try to look for it in there.

That's where I found Sapporo...and the huge line. By now it's 8:11pm (I got off the train at 7:30) and there's a pretty decent line. I cue up and then a lady comes out yelling at me that they are not accepting any more customers, that the people in front of me are the last people they are going to serve.

I told him that I didn't care to fix a single problem that they found as I am just here for the oil change. He then Shows me the cabin air filter, which is terrible looking. I ask him how much yo replace it. I know the standard air filters are about $10 if they were to charge me $15 I'd pay the connivence fee and just have him put a clean one back in.  The guy told me that they replace them for $40 bucks. I told him for the $30 markup I'd just drive to the parts store buy a $40 K&N filter open the glove box and clip in the new filter myself. This is when the sliminess of their sales practices kicked in. He began to tell me that theirs was a great value.  He told me that K&N filters were $100 he knows because he just bought one. I told him he got ripped off because I bought one a year ago and it was $40. He then pointed out a few small chips in the front windshield and tried to grimace at how bad they were. I told him that I literally just left the windshield repair shop 10 mins ago to fix the rock chip that needed attention. When I was at the rock chip repair shop I pointed out the other 3 and they told me they were cosmetic and didn't need to be filled. Again when I told him that he questioned if I went to a reputable repair place.

The eggs were all on the other end of the ""sandwich"" so I didn't even see what they look like.  I stared at it for a minute and then took one tiny bite, which confirmed that the croissant had no flavor and was basically just bad bread in croissant form. I then offered it to my husband.  He didn't even want the bacon, which tells you how bad it looked.  It went straight into the trash.

1. Dining options are super limited. A reservation was required for every place except the 24 hour quick service restaurant.  The food there was subpar and has very limited on options. On top of that after 10pm they only offer pizza. 

2. You could order room service instead but it was ridiculously over priced. High priced meal items, 3 dollar delivery charge, plus an 18% gratuity charge. We called 3 times and each time they said they were backed up with long wait times because ""it was the only thing open besides the 24 restaurant.""

3. The rooms were nice overall, but they walls were paper thin. We constantly heard people down the hall, as well as kids running by.

"879",1,"On May 19, 2018, at approximately 3:30 pm, my husband and I came across the Bluehour outdoor seating area.  We were looking forward to a snack and a drink.  Since we have a small, well behaved dog on leash, we sat down at one of the 7 or 8 tables, the last one in the row.  There seemed to be only one waiter, who was middle aged and white.  He seemed very pre-occupied with all the tables at the other end of the row.  He never once acknowledged us, greeted us, or or made eye contact with us.  He also helped another couple who sat down five minutes after us at the other end.  After ten minutes of no service, we flagged down the busboy, and asked for menus, which he promptly brought us, along with water.  The waiter was running back into the restaurant yet again fetching something for other customers, when we called to him ""are you our waiter?""  He nodded yes and ran into the restaurant. We finally had enough and left after 15 minutes of waiting.  All the other tables were filled with white customers and we are Asian American.  I can only conclude that this waiter is a racist and that is why he blatantly ignored us.   I thought Portland was a progressive and welcoming city.  One racist waiter doesn't represent Portland, but he is representing Bluehour. 
I hope management reads this review.  Neither my husband nor I have ever experienced this type of treatment at any restaurant.   I will tell all those I know about the treatment we received there, including my son who just leased office space across the street.  If I could give this place a negative ten rating, I would.

Everything looks good, terrace like patio on the side with climbing vines, pizza doughs being tossed in the kitchen, families and friends crowded in and looking happy, healthy and well fed. It's like a fricking Olive Garden commercial!

But that's where the yum ends for me. The menu is overwhelming with pizzas and pastas listed line by line on the back. You place your pasta order by choosing a sauce and then picking a pasta: cheese filled tortellini is how we rolled. Pizzas are big! A medium had 8 pieces, if I'm not mistaken. 

All signals looked like a go--looked good, smelled yummy...but then the oceans of salt started flooding, first with the huge capers that looked genetically modified and then came the horror when I couldn't save my tortellini from drowning in a sea of ""butter Parmesan sauce."" 

I should have known from the start (I'll be heard saying later as I beg for water): They sat us at a wobbly table right next to the door, when other, more appealing tables were just as easy to sit us at, gave us the chewiest, greasiest bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar that I have ever had, and had Parmesan cheese in one of those shakers like at Boston Pizza.

With a week off of work, I flew up to Columbus to visit a dear friend that I had not seen since I moved to Florida. From there, I was travelling to Dallas to visit a college friend and see the Red Wings take on the Stars. After a quick 1.5 days in Texas, I was headed back to Tampa.

Was able to avoid the myriad weather delays on the way in to Ohio, but had no such luck on the way out. I was simultaneously worried about the delay, being able to get to Texas at all, and the squabble I was having with my significant other back home. Eff this, I need a beer.

Headed down to Chili's and grabbed the biggest Yuengling draft they had to calm my nerves. It was getting to be about dinner time, and with no end in sight for the delay, decided to get some wings as well. They did the job, nothing special.

I know, airport prices, but I was still shocked to pay more for the beer ($10) than the wings ($8). Server was more interested in chatting with the bartender. Would much rather have gone to Donato's but it was not open.

To conclude this story: after a four hour delay, I was put on a flight to St. Louis five minutes before it left and connected to a different Dallas flight from there, arriving marginally later than I was originally scheduled to.",-1
"887",1,"I went in on a Sunday with Friends for drinks.  Unfortunately, the tall muscular bartender ignored me and my older friends for at least 10 minutes at the bar as we waived $20's in the air.  He wouldn't even acknowledge us as we watched young guys get free cups of water and ice.  Not a good way to run a business.  An older bartender at the end of the bar finally was nice enough to serve us.  My money will go elsewhere and I do have money unlike the 18 year olds which are drinking water for free.",-1
"888",1,"Food poisoning alert.

I ate wings from Jack's on 5/22, 5 days later I am still sick after a massive bout of food poisoning. The only other meal that I ate that day was cereal, so my doctor and I deduced that it was food poisoning from the meal at Jack's as all the symptoms fit.

The onset of the illness hit about 6 hours after consuming the wings and I still have not completely recovered after 5 days, which means I'll need to go back to the doctor again.

They may respond to the review and tout their upstanding food handling practices, but whatever practices those may be, they failed that night. I suggest that you stay away because a 10 dollar box of wings could cost you much more. 

I use to eat here quite a bit but never again. I hope it doesn't happen to anyone else because this is a truly wretched feeling.",-1
"889",1,"My wife really wanted to try these,  due to all the hype.  I don't eat donuts so,  i can't comment on the product.  However, since I went with her, I thought it's just donuts! It can't hurt. Then I walked inside and saw a nice place! But then I heard the music playing over the speakers.  The music made me wish I never stepped inside,  and wish I could get out of this line.  Who the hell thought playing ""death metal "" over the speakers made people feel like eating a treat? The entire time wasting my 25 minutes of my life away to please my wife. I was forced to listen to what some call music.  I will never go to another one.  If I wanted to hear music that made me feel like hurting someone, a donut shop is not where I would want to go.  She got her donuts,  so she was happy about that,  but after spending all that time in line having all negativity blasting in our ears,  we both decided no donuts is worth that torture.  Never will we go into that building.  And if anyone  ever asks us our opinion,  we will warn them to bring noise canceling headphones.  According to My wife,  donuts were good.  Atmosphere however can go to hell.  Well,  the music already feels like torture,  so I guess you are already in hell when your chose to walk inside.",-1

However, if after waiting two hours for our food (a salad, kids macaroni, kids pizza, and fajitas) and over-filling ourselves with free chips and salsa wasn't enough, having the family next to us getting their entrees before us when they arrived after us, was unacceptable. The waitress may have apologized and pleaded it wasn't her fault, but a sure sign that it was in fact partly so when she her first mistake was not getting our drink orders until she was ready to finally get our meal orders a half hour after we first sat down. Needless to say, we walked out. I think this time was the straw that broke the camel's back. I will never go back again.",-1

I had to get something Boston), and salted chocolate (one of my favorites).  

The red velvet was really dry.  The Boston cream pie had a good balance of custard cream and chocolate.  The salted chocolate had bits of sea salt that were all collected on the top, in pieces too big, and ended up being way too salty.  

You get a discount as you buy more cupcakes which I haven't seen offered at any cupcake shop but... I guess you'll just have to pick the best ones by trial and error.",-1

"894",1,"The Adobo chicken is one of the best dishes to be had downtown.  It is consistently excellent in the tacos, sandwiches and the quesadilla.  If the review was based upon food only, I would give it five stars.

Unfortunately, the service I received yesterday was without question the worst I have ever encountered.  With a sign that clearly read that they were open until 2:30pm, I was greeted at 2:05pm by a rude, surly and unkempt young man who abruptly informed me that they were no longer serving food. I actually stood in stunned silence, barely able to comprehend the bad (almost hostile) attitude.  When informed that the sign said they closed at 2:30, he said the kitchen closed at 2:00.  He also then said, with heavy contempt ""there's a lot of restaurants around here, why don't you try one of them?""

He's right, there are a lot of restaurants in downtown.  Enough, in fact, that I will no longer bother to give Arturo's any of my money.

"898",1,"I have to agree with most of the posts here. I truly hate to give bad reviews, but there is not any doubt that this place had earned its 1 star. 

I too, have received horrible service from Town Park Nails. The atmosphere is... a bit uncomfortable, the employees do seem to care more about what is on TV or are just too into their conversation with other fellow coworkers to truly do a good job on your nails and provide you with a comfortable and friendly atmosphere. 

The straw that broke the camel's back was when I requested to have a female employee attend my pedicure instead of a man. They looked at me as if I was insane and that I requested the most ridiculous thing! In my opinion, my request was neither insane nor unreasonable. I am sure that I am not alone when I, as a woman, feel uncomfortable for a man to handle my feet. I got looks... there was more talk in their language and I felt completely and utterly embarrassed! 

I am 100% never, EVER, going back to them again.

These are my two cents.
Hope this helps you guys!

"901",2,"We decided to have our valentine's day dinner at E.B.O which is located within the Grand Villa Casino and Delta hotel. At first glance the ambiance was quite nice, and the hostess was very attentive, however, being a big hallmark holiday, the restaurant wasn't very busy at all which I thought was rather unusual. Because it wasn't very busy, I expected exceptional service and food considering that it is part of a hotel and all. But to much despair we were very let down. I had waited over half an hour for my cocktail which was sitting at the bar waiting to be picked up and brought over to my table at which point it wasn't even cold anymore (it cost $10 for that cocktail which the pricing is on par with say a Hawksworth cocktail but this one didn't even taste very good). The food was overly salty, and when addressed, the server brought back a bowl of blanched assorted mushrooms to replace the sauteed ones that I had mentioned were overly salty. Listen, i could make blanched mushrooms at home, why would I go to a nice restaurant to have them blanch mushrooms for me...it wasn't even busy.

The biggest disappointment comes at the end of our meal. Throughout the evening, we were very patient, respectful and courteous to our server, a Mr. Gallagher, but towards the end of our meal he had not brought us the complimentary truffle pops that we noticed other servers had brought to the other guests in the restaurant until we had inquired about them. Upon returning with the pops he just dropped them on our table whereby the glass container they were contained in actually bounced a few times and the sugar within had spilled over the table and he just walked away...my partner and I felt that it was very rude of him and he didn't thank us at all even after we paid. I work in hospitality myself, and from observing other servers throughout the night which seemed to be a lot more intent to provide service, our server was not fit to be a server, perhaps he should go back to bussing tables and observe his colleagues. His attitude ruined the entire dinner for us and frankly those truffle pops did not sweeten this restaurant for us, leaving me to rank it 2 out of 5 stars. I will not return unless management does something about the service.",-1

After saying it would be made immediately, I sat and continued to wait for another twenty minutes.

"904",1,"Very poor customer service. Had a groupon which is how I thought of trying this place. The coupon was already redeemed as I had used 2/3 services of the coupon. I had my last appointment on 4/30 as the lady kept saying she was all booked out. On the way to the salon for my appointment, I got into a small accident and got late. I called up the salon to ask if it was worth coming in from the area where I was stuck. The lady said she was also running busy and we could reschedule for later. I thought that was reasonable as I would have been at least 20 min late if I went in. 

I called in the next day for an appointment only to be told that the coupon had expired and she would not use it any longer. Additionally, she was rude enough to say that the third service was just a bonus and I should be happy after having received received services twice. Really ? Why advertise it that way then !

It seemed to me that she was unhappy that I had a voucher to use. Moreover, when I argued that she had already redeemed my voucher from Groupon for 3 rounds of  services which was not true, she seemed annoyed. This in spite of the fact that I had tipped well for my prior services (25 and 30 USD) 

I live in the area and could have been a potential long term customer if only they had a better customer service ! I have never not been ""accomodated"" for unforeseen events.

The wait staff was slow and not friendly.  There was only two other tables besides us and it took us 10 minutes to place our order and get coffee. It was snowing outside and the restraunt was just as cold. We had to keep all of our layers of clothes on which was not comfortable. When we finally received our food it was extremely bland.

"908",2,"This update is about bands playing inside only. 

Went here to see a band of so many I've had the wonderful opportunity to listen to at Mohawk. It's become one of my favorite places to listen to my bands.  Yes, they are all mine....

I remember why I never liked this place for indoor music.  Before it was Mohawk, in one of its many morphings along the way, there was only inside band space. (Thank you x 3 for building an awesome outdoor stage area!) So, over the 13+ years of our patronage in this location, we learned a few things.  One of them is why we never came here for music unless it was a small unknown band. And I got a swift reminder to never break that rule. 

The indoor playing area is tiny. Its also unfortunately rectangular. So, unless you're a good 6 foot, you can't see unless you're 10 feet or closer to the stage. A stage, that is elevated a meager 12 inches. If you don't mind listening to your favorite band in the remainder of the bar area, it's fine, and you can probably get a seat. Yet, if actually seeing the band is part of your experience, I say, wait to see if that band is playing somewhere else.   This indoor playing area is just too cramped and really shitty if you want to walk away to get a beer. Come back, and a wall of people to greet you and make your trek back to 'your' spot so much more difficult than it should be. People are crammed in the space and it gets so freakin' hot and sweaty, which with 95 degree nights, makes it ever so much worse. Yet, being outside feels better than in the sardin can inside. 

Great place for live music,  OUTside.  If you aren't sure, check the bill. It will say something referencing inside or out.  Don't recommend inside unless the band isn't your utmost fav or you really want to sit, which can quite likely happen if you're diligent.  Still my fav music venue, just won't be making another stop for indoor playing any time soon.",-1

In a pinch, I hoped this would be a place for ""Suburban Factory Food the Safe Mom"".  Nope.  I would rather have spent my money at Chili's or McDonald's.  And with the size of the building, I was hoping too for at least a halfhearted effort to have beer served that was actually brewed on-site.  Nope.

Service was slow and borderline of poor, the portions were smaller than I expected, and the beer was good but overpriced.  The fried chicken --with a scant plop of gravy-- tasted similar to Chick-Fil-A so one star there.

From Wikipedia:  ""The BJ's Restaurants Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to support charities benefiting children's health care and education, with primary focus on the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. ""  So another star there.

I would not recommend this place to anyone!!! I stayed there a week and the first night we got in pretty late and the room we had the toilet felt like it was going to break,  the lock didn't work, the floors were so dirty it was tough to let my infant daughter crawl on them so I went the next morning and told them, the gentleman was nice enough to move me to the next room which was easy for me cause I had an infant and had to move all my things by myself with her. Well while in that room the room next to us had a conjoining door and as I was feeding my daughter I over heard them talking about the different effects that herion and crack does to you so I went and told them I wasn't comfortable with that as I had not only my daughter there with me but my teenage sons coming to visit while I was there (I'm from Texas visiting my boys) so they moved me to the 4th floor. This room was the best out of them all. Newer beds I guess and the floor was cleaner almost looked like newer carpet. Well we continued our week there and I wanted to stay one more night so I called the front desk and asked if I got another night would I need to change rooms. Stephanie said she didn't know. Well I got another night and she made me go down to the 2nd floor again into the room I was in first. She said the issue had been fixed ( which it hadn't) so I had to pack up all of our things that we had been for a week (nothing's in place etc) and move my daughter and I down 2 floors again. 
The manager Stephanie was VERY rude a true bitch, that I called customer care on her 3 times just in the morning. I went to talk to the GM and all he could tell me was that she's been with them a long time and that's just the way she is. 
From the looks of the reviews I've seen she's a big complaint and they continue to keep her...

Fish and chips- not much fish at all.  All batter.  The fries used to be great.  Not so anymore; using the fast-food quality fries instead of the prior smaller potato cuts.

"918",1,"I went to this Sephora yesterday and will never go back. I went to buy some Bare Escentuals makeup for the first time. The lady who helped me probably had on the worst makeup I have ever seen. She had very thick, obvious concealer under her eyes, makeup too dark for her skin, obvious shading on her face, awful silvery frosted lipstick, BLACK lipliner, and very heavy, unflattering eye makeup. This, in a place where the customers are tasteful and refined? I was very hesistant to take her advice, because I certainly had no desire to look like her.
The first color she put on me did not even come close to matching my skin. Shew told it it looked fine. I then asked to try a different color, when she told me matched and looked fine. She definitely gave me the impression she really couldn't care less. 
After that I wandered around for a little while while everyone ignored me. There were about 4 employees and two customers including me, so I guess they were too busy......
Then the cashier was really cold and snooty.
I am going to return the makeup today, because guess what- it's the wrong color! Only I am going to the Sephora in the Pru, where they have nice, friendly employees who know something about makeup!
Update: now that I got the correct color at a different store, and have been watching the video that came with the ""get started"" set, I see that the lady who helped me at Chestnut Hill did not even show me the correct way to apply the makeup.

"924",1,"This place is way overrated... Im not from the area, and my GF whos from there, gassed this place up to be something special. Went on a Friday night recently, around 8. Some lady who worked there helped us find a spot in their lot, which was a nice touch, as parking in SoBo is beyond attrocious, cars might as well be banned from parking within the city limits. We sat near the bar area...Hella loud in there, sounded like some obnoxious souls were in the vicinity. Yelling and hollering and such,I mean i get it its a a bar but it was only around 8. We get seated and waited around 10m to get a waitress to our table. Service overall was really slow. After we got our decent cocktails, another 15-20m passed before we got approached to order meals. 

As for the food, we decided to just get entrees. My Gf got the pork chop and it seemed to crisped on the outside, almost burnt. Her risotto was decent, but overall it was lackluster. I was gunna opt for the prime rib, they were out of it at the time. No biggie I had a lobster pie in the on deck circle...So I got it, really rubbery and quite bland. The portion wasnt that great either. Not sure why I got fries with it, but I did. The fries were ok, oversalted thought. We waited another 15m after we were done for the check. When the check came, my GF and I split the bill...For the food and service we got, this place is overpriced...I heard the quality took a dive after they remodeled it, from my GF whos been going there for a while. Seems like the place is surviving on name/prior reputation and old time regulars. I wouldnt go back. Week later we went to the Lincoln Tavern up the road, and I was blown away that place was incredible and a better value.

Final note, after I ate here and checked some other reviews the night of, I stumbled across one of the restaurants customer service reps for yelp, Don. His replies were very unprofessional, belittling of the reviewer, yet entertaining, due to the fact  I couldn't believe someone who represents the establishment would write such things. I read all the poor reviews to see him go to the point of attacking the patron and accusing them of being at fault for their poor service, never seen anything like it. In this case, on a public forum its probably better to let the poor reviews stand alone, rather than make the establishment look a bush league eatery.",-1

When I went back to report the damage the manager started arguing with me, denying it happened in their wash & refusing to amend any of the damage. After about 15 min of his defensive arguing he reluctantly agreed to refund what I paid for the car wash. I will never return to this place & would not recommend it to anyone!!",-1
"926",1,"I used to love Bugaboo when I was little, and when the one in Watertown closed I was pretty disappointed, so imagine my happiness when I found out there's one still open in Braintree. Unfortunately...it's pretty awful. 

The bread they serve is okay, but it's clearly trying to be Outback bread, which is infamously good, and theirs is just a cheap imitation. Side note: boyfriend is in love with Outback bread, so a few months ago I tried to make it for him. This was the first time in probably ten years I made bread from scratch and while it wasn't as good as the real thing, it was waaaaayyyyy better than Bugaboo bread.

I got the Black Magic steak with asparagus. The asparagus was almost raw, had an unpleasant taste, and I got the distinct impression that it had been microwaved. Bleh. 

Now on to the steak. This steak was terrible. The waitress hovered waiting for me to cut it to ensure it was cooked properly, which is fine I guess but really awkward. It was cooked fine, but OH my glob did it taste bad. The seasoning was just confusing and gross, aside from a lot of salt I couldn't identify a single flavor.

I absolutely hate sending food back, but I had to. I didn't want to say, 'this tastes like it fell on the floor' so I just said it was too salty, and the waitress seemed really confused...? She told me it was seasoned, and then came back to say it was Cajun seasoning. I don't think anyone working there has even been in the same room as Cajun food.

The manager came over and while he wasn't exactly rude, he seemed almost offended, and again mentioned that it was seasoned (yes, I know, I read the menu description, thanks). He just kept harping on the fact that it was seasoned as if I couldn't understand it. Like Bugaboo is serving up such exotic food that my peasant palate just couldn't handle it. Whatever.

I got their chicken sandwich as a replacement, it was pretty average. Not bad, not great, just a thing. Boyfriend got a burger, said it was just okay. The manager kept coming over to ask how it was going, and talking to the waitress. I'm not sure, but I got the impression that he was mad at her, as if their crappy food is her fault.

Overall, huge disappointment. The service was fine, the manager was annoying, the food was terrible.",-1
"927",1,"Wished I had seen all these reviews before I went. My advice - stay away. 

First experience - pretty good. Ipod repaired in a couple of hours. After 97 days, same problem happened so I took it back to them. I was told me that I was outside of the 90 day warranty period and that I would have to pay $10 diagnostic. When I tried to reason with him, he was extremely rude and walked away while I was mid-sentence. Then he basically kicked me out of the store. Definitely stay away from this store.",-1

Service is hit or miss.

CORRECTION TO THE ABOVE REVIEW .....if you order sashimi, expect to get paper thin sashimi. I asked my waitress to check with the chef and ask why suddenly my sashimi had changed in size so drastically and she came and told me that the ""chef said sashimi prices went up so they have to cut the pieces smaller""........what kind of an answer is that?!?! I've been a loyal customer for years and suddenly they cut the pieces into 1/3 of what they used to and still charge the same. It's like, raise the prices if you can't afford it but don't expect customers to be okay with short changing them and acting like it's not a big deal. Absurd. I'm very disappointed, and I have vowed to not return and my friends know about this too and have no plans to go back either.",-1

"932",1,"My wife and I went to this place 8 months ago and spent a lot of money for a ring. That was our first two mistakes.  The ring has needed repaired two times. We had purchased their so called warranty, the think about this is they take the money but don't honor the warranty. We went there today with the ring again and the diamond is about to fall out. As soon as we entered we should have turned around. The first two people we see can't speak English, and the third did but couldn't really understand it.  We told her what we needed and gave her the paperwork for the ring. She came back and said the warranty is only good 6 months. That's not what they sale when you buy it. They refused to fix the ring and suggested we take it to Kay's jewelers to have it fixed. That was unbelievable and I ask for the manager. She went to get the ""manager"" who claimed to be to busy. I am guessing  she didn't have any answers or couldn't speak English or maybe even both. We will never do business with Jared's again and will only do business with  real jeweler. I strongly recommend don't go to Jared's for anything.  They are not honest and will not honor any agreements.",-1

Then not even touching anything, they tell her three pipes need replaced and blindsided her with a bill for just the estimate of for $167.. It was not on a weekend or at night, nor do we live out-of-town. For the actual repairs they quoted $500. For three pipes and less than an hours worth of work?!

She declined Casey's services and called Apollo. They came out right away, gave a free estimate, and did all the work Casey's was going to do, but for just $139.

We had Casey's come out before, and were always happily satisfied. But now, we will never call or recommend them again.",-1

"937",1,"Don't waste your time or money. Sure the super expensive seats are nice and comfy but the service is terrible and the food isn't that great. The first time I went turned into a nightmare because I didn't understand the seating chart. I figured if I was paying $50 for two seats they would be reasonable - but NO. They were the seats right up front (thank goodness they were at least in the middle). The chairs were comfortable but you are forced to use the right hand side tray and cup holder (I'm left-handed so that royally sucked). So these seats DO NOT get a waiter - you have to order your food out in the lobby and bring it in. Pray that you don't sit next to someone that orders something stinky (which sadly didn't happen to me). I smelled something horrible the entire movie long that made me want to vomit and made the experience that much worse. 
2nd time - no better. Spent WAY too much money on the big cushy seasts with the servers. They were rude, took WAY too long, got my order wrong twice and the food was cold and not good when it finally came out the correct way. I politely asked to speak to the manager after the movie was over to ask for some sort of refund or credit for the horrible service and they laughed at me. I wish had punched someone - but I didn't. So I'm leaving this review.",-1

"941",2,"I laugh when I think about this place. I can't really complain about it because I got what I paid for. When one stays here they basically are getting disney's version of a motel. I don't even know what to say bad about this place because it's exactly what I would expect for the price that was paid. It was full of loud children that seemed to get a kick out of vomiting in the pool. When somebody would flush the toilet in the next room I could hear it...to be perfectly honestly, if somebody even breathed in the next room I could hear it. It smelled absolutely horrible. The view made me smile because it was a joke. The tacky, overt statues and ""time line"" figures were just placed to disguise the motel-esque quality of the ""resort.""

I must admit that this place is perfect for a person with a lot kids because they can get an adequate room for a cheap price. 

So overall, I give this place a 5/5 for large families and for people who just want a place to lay their heads at night. 1/5 for people who like to relax and for people who like grand resorts/hotels.",-1

As I walked up to the car, the driver did not get out of the car to hand me my food, he simply stayed in the car. Then as I gave him my money, he requested a tip. I stated, I would not be giving one because he was rude and they charged a delivery fee. As he angrily sped away, he told me never to order from there again.",-1

After waiting 40 minutes to be seated, I asked the waitress if we could get the scrambled eggs for my little 2 year old boy because he can't eat it the way they prepare it for adults (he would probably get stomach ache) and she said no.  When I asked if they could bring the kid order out first because my boy was hungry after waiting for 40 minutes and was starting to complain she looked at me like I was making a very unusual request.

"945",1,"Be Aware! Banfield is a wellness practice,  wellness visits take priority over sick dogs. High turnover rate. New vet almost every visit although they are all very nice.
My dog, a wellness plan patient of 3 years got very sick. I couldnt get an appointment for several days so I had to bring her to Woburn Veterinary Hospital that night spending $500.00. 
The next day when I called for a follow up at Banfield, I was unable to get an appt for a week.

I called a wonderful veterinary hospital  in Marblehead telling them the situation and they saw Layla that day.They continued caring for her for the next three months till I needed to put her to sleep.
The priority at banfield is wellness visits.  A cust svc spec i spoke with from the wellness plan told me that. Sick animals must go to emergency hospitals if they cant wait to be seen 
. I always thought in the 17 years that I have had cats and dogs, all vets put sick animals ahead. Not Banfield.
Also, there is no way to get out of Banfield Wellness Plans no matter the circumstances. Even death  as I read in the fine print..

My coffee mug had lipstick on it and our server would not look at me as I was calling out, ""ma'am, ma'am?"" Trying to get a fresh cup. She finally acknowledged me and brought a fresh cup. I ordered a fit skillet meal that was topped with avocado... it came out with rotten avocado slices that were clearly not edible. Our server brought me more slices from the SAME AVOCADO!! I left it on the plate right at the edge of the table and she ignored it, never checking to see if it was ok. Our kids' meals were not as described, and my husband said his was edible but not great. By the end we asked to speak with the manager to let them know our experience. We are business owners and would like to be given the chance to improve as well... Anyway, she came out and could not have cared less. She tried to make an excuse about the avocado, and then tried to get the conversation over faster by offering us 10% off our ticket.

"954",1,"They really should take down all of those annoying signs claiming there is such a thing as a ""Fast Lane"" on the Mass Pike.  None of the lanes are fast.  In fact, if you drive over 10 MPH through them, it won't scan your transponder and you'll get a citation in the mail.  Awesome.

Speaking of citations, from what I understand, the MA turnpike authority likes to hand those out like lollypops.  I've gotten a couple of them for driving through the fast lane with a perfectly good, functioning transponder with plenty of money loaded on it.  It's not one of the shitty Chinese ones you get from MA (at least you don't have to pay money for those anymore), it's one of the good ones from NY that actually work.  The MA turnpike authority makes you fill out paper work to appeal the $50 citation.  They made the paper work easy to fill out -- you literally check a box if you have a working transponder, which makes me think this type of thing happens ALL THE DAMN TIME. As if it isn't annoying enough that you have to do that in the first place, they hit you with a $5 administrative fee + the price of the toll.  Seriously?  I have to pay you because you fucked up?  I did nothing wrong.  Take the toll money and admit that you made a mistake.  I have a theory that they just randomly pick people to charge a $50 citation to in hopes of making up some of the money that the pike is hemorrhaging.  Here's an idea, get rid of the tolls and you won't need any of the personelle and buildings to run it.

I'm still baffled how they get away with their fines.  Imagine if Walmart worked like the Mass Pike.  I'm sorry ma'am, I overcharged you for your tube socks.  I'll refund the money, but I need to charge you the full price of the socks (not the sale price) and charge your credit card a $5 administrative fee.  There would be massive outrage, and people would boycott Walmart.  I'm pretty sure that would also be illegal, yet it's OK if the state does it.  Just one more example of how screwed up MA is.",-1

The cheeseburger sub was average. Its hard to go wrong with a burger.. the bread could have been toasted or something and they added mayo but didnt add ketchup which i feel like is unheard of.. i didnt even ask for mayo.

I had nachos with chicken.  The chicken was shredded, so there were tiny bones in it... I'm glad I didn't aspirate any of them.  That would've been a quick trip to work on my day off, that's for sure.  It was also G-R-E-A-S-Y, oil dripping off of the saturated tortilla chips when I tried to pick them up.

"961",1,"Unfortunately I have to give one star is where I would like to begin with this review. 

I had an online reservation set noon on a Wednesday, and arrived to a staff member who couldn't even start the process of getting me into a car (no explanation as of why so I can't even continue with that issue). So after quickly moving to the next team member, things began to materialize and I was asked for my credit card for the around 100$ deposit they hold. 

The card was declined (maybe the bank, myself or their machines fault) not sure, so I asked if cash or a debit card would be acceptable and was told it's not. Which is odd enough that enterprise may be the only company in the world that doesn't like cash for its business, but that's a long story for a different time. 

Since that was my only credit card I borrowed a relatives credit card (who drove me there and patiently waited down the long parking garage) and returned to the representative who noticed it wasn't my name on it so I explained I was using a relatives card since my wasn't working. (I'm not upset at anyone at this point but puzzled as to why only credit cards can be used for any transaction so far in the process.) So they explain that this is OK and it will be an extra 15 or 20$ for an additional driver (no big deal in my mind) but they need my relatives drivers license. 
I think to myself OK fair enough... 

However at this point I'm beginning to get a little frustrated and ask do I need anything else since I've had to go back to the car through the entire lot of vehicles to get an item one piece at a time multiple times. I'm asked what seems to be the problem and I frankly state that enterprise doesn't accept cash/debit for its transactions like every other company on the planet so I just wanted to make sure and not have to walk back and forth again. (The entire process up to this point has probably taken nearly a half an hour, and I've also said MULTIPLE TIMES by now that the license and credit card owned by my relative is disabled and cannot walk long distances.) So I'm told by the representative that I need to get the license with it and that's all. 

So now the fun part, I get back to the counter with my relatives credit card and drivers license and who I believe is the manager asks the staff member who was working with me if I had been shown a car yet, she says no and the potentially? Manager starts typing in information on the computer to process my rental. After typing for maybe a minute I'm told that my relative will need to come to the counter as well. (At this point I'm quietly but probably noticeably very frustrated) So since I'm not going to have my relative who cannot walk go up to the counter and hurt himself, I politely and frankly lied saying that ""I appreciate your help today guys but I can't have my relative walk here."" So don't forget, after coming back with the license (after having to go back to get the credit card) I was CLEARLY TOLD I would NOT need anything else. So that was a nice little waste of my time. 

So I left without a rental. After walking that entire lot at least or 5 times, and trying to give enterprise money in 4 or 5 different ways frustrated and wondering how in the world they were able to be that frustrating at all to begin with, let alone give me poor information one piece at a time, and also they really started being somewhat rude and have an attitude when I'm trying to meet their odd demands. Why they couldn't give me the information I needed all at once, or stay polite and professional, or maybe just accept this crazy thing called cash. Or explain why they needed my disabled relative to walk the quarter mile garage of cars and not told me that in the first place.

For what it's worth all of my other enterprise experiences have been quick, smooth, and easy. They earned my loyalty or at least were always my first option when renting vehicles as it was always a smooth transaction. Luckily, in the grand scheme of things, no property was damaged, no one was hurt or killed like other major and more important problems, so life goes on and that's that. But in terms of customer service and having a knowledge of your product, it seemed that the only thing enterprise had knowledge of today was how to be frustrating. So maybe it was the location, or maybe the representatives were having a tough day, but I consider myself very hard to irritate or frustrate but they seemed to go out of their way to give incredibly poor service and for how hard and with what quality I know I work with, I know that I wouldn't be at my job very long if I handled situations as the team at the Orlando (MCO) location handled mine.",-1

"963",1,"I wanted to share my disappointing experience from last night.  I was traveling on Flight #1720 from Montego Bay, Jamaica to Philadelphia with a connection to Boston along with a group of people from work and their families.  I have a life threatening allergy to the cheese found in Doritos and Cheetos.  I do carry 2 Epi-Pens.  Other airlines have been extremely helpful, not American.  I approached the gate agent and let her know about the allergy as I was instructed to do when booking.  I was allowed to board early to wipe down my area.  After most passengers had been seated, I called the flight attendant over.  I asked politely if she was aware of my allergy and if she could say something to the passengers around me.  She said she was not made aware of any allergy and would not be saying anything.  At that point, for my own safety (I was also traveling with my 9 year old son), I turned to the row in back of me and simply said.  I apologize but I have a life threatening allergy to Doritos and Cheetos.  It causes anaphylaxis.  I would really appreciate it if you would refrain from eating those two things on the flight.  The flight attendant then proceeded to verbally attack me and berate me and went as far as to say I was not allowed to speak to anyone around me on the flight that that if I tried to, she would have me removed from the flight.  To my knowledge, I did not think there were rules about speaking with your fellow passengers.  I believe my rights were violated as I asked for a simple accommodation which was to let the people sitting around me know the severity of the allergy.  

It is 2018, many people including infants and children have food allergies.  I would think American would care more about the safety of its passengers.  It would be much more of a pain to passengers if the plan were need to make an emergency landing or did American Airlines plan to let me die if something was to happen in flight.  Even the small child behind me understood.  She said to her mom, I don't know why that lady gave her a hard time, it is just like the kids who sit at the peanut free table in school.  I did offer to show the Epi-pends and had a note from my physician explaining my allergy.

Allergies are also protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal civil rights law. It gives people with disabilities the right to ask for changes where policies, practices or conditions leave you out or put you at a disadvantage. Public companies and places must give people with disabilities full access to all facilities, programs, goods and services. They must also give them the chance to enjoy these places and services just like someone without disabilities.  In both the ADA and Section 504, a person with a disability is someone who has a physical or mental impairment that seriously limits one or more major life activities, or who is regarded as having such impairments. Asthma and allergies are usually considered disabilities under the ADA.

Major life activities include:

Breathing
Eating
Working
Going to school
In 2008, the ADA was changed to include more people in the definition of ""disabled."" Conditions that only show symptoms at certain times are now included. Asthma and allergies fit this definition. The ADA protects people with asthma and allergies even if reactions or attacks happen only when triggered. The ADA can help to create an environment where patients can avoid their triggers.

Also, use of medical aids or devices can no longer exclude them from ADA coverage. For example, it used to be that people with asthma who got relief from an inhaler were not covered by the ADA. The inhaler was thought to have removed the disability. With the 2008 changes, the ADA covers people with asthma and allergies even if medication controls their symptoms.

I guess this is not surprising given American's recent settlement for other ADA violations.

Well there was ""smokiness"" in the form of a hard burned exterior. The bones fell out which is an indication of being overdone and the ends of the bones were burned black. I was able to pick thru and get about 1/2 of the meat that was edible, but mostly dry.

The Brussels sprouts were either burned or barely cooked.  The corn was the only enjoyable element.

I wishe that I could give this place NEGATIVE FIVE STARS !!!

I have only written one other review as I generally do not have time to write reviews. However, I felt incredibly compelled to share my RETAIL NIGHTMARE experience with fellow Yelp patrons. 

Last Saturday, I went into the Spirit Halloween Store with my 6 year old son to look for a Skeleton Costume for Halloween. I was next door at Marshall's so it seemed convenient. This is a  ""Fly by Night"" Seasonal Retail shop (temporary lease from Out of Business Circuit City). 

When I first walked in, I noticed a huge amount of seemingly well stocked  Halloween paraphernalia. I finally located an employee and asked where I might find a Skeleton Costume to fit my son. She took me to the far corner where the closest match was a Zombie skeleton and they had only two costumes (different sizes) !! That seemed strange as one would think that it was a relatively common or popular item. The price was listed as $29 which seemed high considering the quaulity was so low, but WTH it is a seasonal item.  One of them seemed close, and she did say that I could try it on, but there was only one very small and busy area to change so we ""eyeballed it"" and she told me that I could return it for a refund, but had to do so the same day as this was the last day for refunds and afterwards I could only return it for exchange. I went up to the register only to discover that it was actually $ 39 before tax!! I almost left, but decided to purchase it anyway caveating my decision by stating that I might have to return it for a refund later if it did not work out. She said that this would be fine. 

When I got home, I discovered that the cloth was made of the thinnest guaze that tore with your touch and the entire outfit was poorly designed and did not fit. 

I repacked it and took it back to the store for refund a few hours later. When I arrived back at the store, there was a huge line at the register and I saw two clerks including the ""goth dressed girl""  one that had waited on me, the two customers being waited on when I stepped into line were still being waited on 20 minutes later!!! Then the one girl left the register, leaving only one clerk behind to wait on the 9-10  customers in front of me in line. Ten minutes later and the lone clerk was still assisting the same customer that she was when I arrived 30 minutes prior. Finally the goth chick returned with an older female employee with a huge bleached and teased head of hair (not a wig), I was later to learn that her name was ""Sugar"" and that she was the Manager.  Now we finally had three at the register. Thirty minutes later, I finally made it to the register manned by the employee that had assited me hours earlier with my return and receipt in hand. I explained that it did not work out and that I needed to return it for a refund. She stated that Refunds are not allowed under any circumstances. I reminded her of our conversation earlier and she lied and stated that she had never stated that but rather had toild me that that day was the last day to even EXCHANGE an item. In other words they would not even exchange defective merchandise from October 18th through the 31st !!! I mentioned that that was definetely not what she told me and that I would not have purchased the item under those circumstances and that I had mentioned that during the purchase process. I asked to speak to a manager and that's when SUGAR chimed in and stated that this girl was the assistant Mgr. and that she (SUGAR) was the MANAGER! She went on to say that that was the policy and my only option was to keep the merchandise or exchange it for a replacement item immediately (ie. I could not receive a credit or even come back later that day) and of course wait for another hour in line. I explained that this was outrageous and unacceptable and she screamed at me and yelled that I needed to leave ""Her"" store immediately!!!! I demanded a phone number for the company and asked for her full name, which she gave me.  

I left feeling that I had already had my Halloween experience in the House of Horrors!  I will follow up with them, but be forewarned, this store is full of cheap, very overpriced merchandise, rude employees and awful policies. 

There are many choices in Austin. DON'T SHOP HERE!!",-1
"968",1,"Worse place ever. They treat their customers horribly and are rude. Even the manager was rude. I hope this place gets shut down and taken over by those who own patio. Don't go here don't waste your money!!!",-1
"969",2,"I have been going to the iPic location at the Domain in Austin TX since it opened. I have always been impressed by it and always go the for huge blockbuster movies far better than Alamo or Flix. I was really disappointed with my visit yesterday.  First we were not seated 30 minutes prior to the start of the film but more like 10 minutes. This caused the service to be more than a bit lacking. It took 15 minutes before we were even greeted which is highly unusual. Second there was a bad smell of mildew from what I am guessing was wet carpet. For it to smell that bad means it wasn't a recent spill. For a movie that cost $50 to walk in the door then another $40 (minimum) to eat or drink was sad. We have now decided to visit Moviehouse & Eatery which is farther away to find a new favorite if iPic continues this.",-1
"970",2,"I don't eat here regularly although it's just a 5 min. walk from where I live.  I came here when I first moved to Waltham and I had the steak tip salad.  The iceberg lettuce just didn't go well with the overly charred steak tips.  It was so disappointing.  I would reccommend getting a standard pizza or something of that variety because I hear Cappy's can get that right.",-1
"971",1,"NEVER EVER VISIT THIS PLACE !! It is one of the horrible restaurants I visited in my life. The food was watery and stale, there are no good varieties. It was sickening to sit in the place to eat. They charged me ~ 15 bucks for a stale food. I would never never visit this restaurant. PLEASE AVOID VISITING THIS PLACE - TO SAVE YOUR TIME, MONEY.",-1
"972",1,"I got a Brazilian wax from them once and they did in under 15 minutes. I had ingrown hairs from the wax and the process was extremely painful. Mind you, I been waxing my downstairs area for over 3 years, one per month. Not just that, but she didn't even wipe away the wax with oil. I was left in a sticky mess. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE PRICE! With or without the Groupon for that matter.",-1
"973",2,"I want to try this place again, given the reviews on here and the look/feel of it I expected much better from it.  I will update my review once I have a chance to go here again.

I tried the steak fajita wrap and was not overly impressed.  I think I may have gotten the wrong wrap for me.  For starters, I figured a steak fajita wrap would have chunks of steak, but instead it was shaved steak like you would use in a steak bomb.  Given my expectations, this did not hit the spot at all.  The portion was good, definitely a filling meal, so it did have that going for it.",-1
"974",1,"Nice customer service but the quality of the food was TRASH! I ordered the Buffalo tender combo. Buffalo tenders were hardly covered in sauce leaving a lot of the breading exposed. The fries had a strong taste of FISH GREASE so much so that I had to let someone else taste one because I thought it was me but they agreed that fries tasted as if they were fried in old fish grease as well. Needless to say I dumped the entire plate in the trash so I dumped $7 along with it basically. I did call back to let them know that the food was not good and they offered 10% off my next meal which most likely I won't ever use because I won't be going back.",-1
"975",2,"I've eaten at Seven Lamps twice now, both experiences being less than impressive. First time, a friend and I came by hoping to get a cocktail and a few appetizers after shopping at Lenox. We arrived to learn that the interior of the restaurant  was sold out for a baby shower. Yes, a baby shower. Most of the outdoor seating was already reserved so we were pushed off to the far end of the sidewalk. That said, the cocktails and cheese plate were great.

Next up, my partner and I came in for the Bo Ssam special advertised on Creative Loafing. We had reservations for two at 7, arrived a few minutes early and were promptly seated in what is undoubtedly the worst seat in the house. We were at the far end of an 8-person dining table by the server check out station. There were two empty bar height tables along the wall, but both were covered with silverware and napkins. A few minutes after we were seated, the hostess came and cleared off the table and sat a couple there. Wish we had asked! We couldn't escape the noise of the kitchen, prep and expo yet didn't get the perk of a real chef's table. In spite of most of the restaurant being unoccupied, another couple was seated at the other end of our table after half an hour or so. Our seats were so loud we had a hard time hearing one another and only occasionally had any of the music filter through. Speaking of, really glad I heard that great Jack Johnson hit and that even better Counting Crows song. The Optimist this is not.

Now, for the food and drinks. The cocktails were great, loved my cheese plate and heirloom tomato salad. Partner enjoyed his lobster roll. 
The Bo Ssam itself was less inspiring. The CL listing said tonight's selection was LOBSTER and shrimp Bo Ssam. Surprise, it was chicken! Not even poor man's lobster - not even seafood! That was very disappointing. The corn tortillas were very coarse and dense, blocking out a lot of flavor. We ended up doing lettuce wraps and ditched the tortillas altogether.

Overall, I'd give the food 3 stars but it feels like the chef and host have given very little thought to the full dining experience. Skip the stale 90s music, ditch the family-style dining which guarantees no privacy for your conversations, maybe consider moving into a larger space.",-1
"976",2,"The service was fast I will give them that. My roommate and I ordered eggs Benedict and when we got them mine was drowned in so much hollandaise sauce that the server actually said ""oops, that might spill off the plate"" which it did. I sent it back because it was so soggy and didn't even taste good. My roommate tried to still eat it but stopped after a few bites because her side of hashbrowns were cold and hard, basically undercooked. She asked for it to be taken off her bill and i saw the manager in the back look annoyed. The manager only took off $4 of the $12 that was supposed to be the eggs benedict, even though she hadn't even made a dent on plate. So i paid for that and my replacement pancake and will not be returning.",-1
"977",1,"the waitress is  in a bad mood who doesnt even separate the check for me and forces us to pay in one bill.",-1
"978",1,"The wait killed the taste we should of enjoyed.  An hour for fries, tacos, and sliders was a joke.  Sliders were disappointing because the consisted of a lot of burned ends.  Bread for burger and sliders were great.  I just expected a better meal for such a long wait.",-1
"979",2,"great service and nice ambience. food was terrible and disappointing.",-1
"980",2,"Locally owned.  

All homemade stuff and hand made waffle cones.  

Pricey for serving size given and up charge rates for ""crush ins"" are unreasonable.  Two large dish ice cream with one topping each came to $12.50 total.  Look  ....  at .90 cents for about 1/4 of a Heath bar in a large dish what do you expect  .....  come on people !!! 

The place is usually staffed by teenage girls and if you can catch them paying attention to the customer and not each other the service is good.

However, it does smell ""off"" almost like sour milk (another reviewer mentioned this way back April 2011)  and makes me not want to see the back room or the floors behind the ice cream counter.  Store concrete floors are chipped badly (get some replacement paint quick)  and counters are sticky constantly ... hard to make teenage girls clean I guess ... .what with so much visiting to have to do you know.

Anyway, ice cream is just above average and i don't think it outshines Amy's at all like others have suggested.  I go because it is close but would try another place if an option out here were available, maybe something will open up in the new Alamo Draft House business park at Slaughter and MoPac.

But like I have mentioned in my Amy's review earlier on Yelp,  it needs a good cleaning and someone to walk through from time to time from management with their eyes open to critical review of the WHOLE shop.",-1
"981",1,"Food poisoning!!!!  The food looked great. Ordered a salad from the deli bar, seared eggplant,  and hummus.  Food poisoning kicked in with in an hour. So sick for about 3 hrs.

This is not a place I would go back to.",-1
"982",1,"It was my 3rd time visit to this place for car wash and it is my last time. No more. As the other customer said, the man who works here is VERY RUDE! I came during a weekday's noon today, so there was no attendance at the entrance. I bought my wash using their touch machine. It was so confused that I didn't see the option to get the token for vacuum. I approached the man after the wash and explained the situation. He screamed and yelled at me and pointed on a small sign on how to get the token. No big deal if I d├│nt get the token, but come on! No need to scream at me on your whole confusing process for car wash. Their touch device for ordering the wash is very sensitive by the way. I just want to select a regular external wash ($4), but somehow it selected Delux wash ($8), and there was no way to cancel it out! Customers beware!",-1
"983",1,"I had been here once or twice, the food wasn't great, neither was the service, but it is close and relatively inexpensive.

Went back early on a Saturday for a drink and some lunch (after a long study session).  It was relatively empty, save for a few crowds of obvious ""regulars"" whom the bartender knew by name.  When I asked if they had a jalapeno poppers, the bartender (a suggestively dressed woman in her 50s) suggested I go across the street, which I thought to be odd, as I have never had someone in the industry suggest I go elsewhere for service.  I thought for a moment that perhaps they didn't appreciate the ""college crowd"", but dismissed that immediately considering that I am 30-something professional.

From there, the service only got worse, and quickly.  The other patrons all seemed nice (all in their 50s or above, generally friendly, video poker playing crowd).  Our food was cold, our empty glasses sat there FOREVER, and she would walk away while when we spoke to her about anything, and when we did engage her, she was ridiculously rude, there really is no other way to describe the treatment me and my friend received other than ridiculous and uncalled for.  We had been in high spirits when we arrived, and were feeling quite dejected by the time we had finally gotten our check, only to realize we had been SEVERELY upcharged.  Like, almost $10 a drink for a normally $5-6 drink (like I said, I had been there before, our drinks were not double nor top shelf).

I told my friend that due to her behavior AND the upcharging on top of it,  I would not be tipping.  I used to work in the industry, and had I ever treated a customer like that, I wouldn't have kept my job, let alone a couple of women who did nothing to deserve it.  My friend still tipped, but whatever.

We left, and upon pulling out of our parking spot, another car whipped out and drove almost into our vehicle, head on (we had stopped).  We put our car in reverse, and this one advanced, this time beside us.  I thought it was a severely intoxicated patron, until the woman motioned for us and rolled down our window--surprise!  She was a patron whom the bartender had sent to confront us for not tipping!  (Which no one would have known, as we handed her our cash directly!).  She not only confronted us for not tipping, but called us a few choice names, then peeled out of the parking lot.

Terrible service + awful treatment/attitude + siccing another patron on us = worst bar ever.  I wish I had taken her recommendation and gone to the other bar.  I can't believe the lack of class of the bartender, and this bar.

I wish I could leave it 0 stars.",-1
"984",2,"Two stars for the one lovely cast member who is always friendly and helpful. If it weren't for her, I would never step foot in this location. It's small, but that would be okay and expected ... However, the service is very lacking.

I have never been so insulted- she was nasty, she rolled her eyes, and she walked away in a huff. I will never go back to this location.",-1
"985",1,"Still at Waves Car Wash in Dedham.  Bought regular car wash.  Rims still very dirty.  They said I paid for car wash.  Needed to pay extra $5.00 if I want rims clean.  Took picture but can't attach.  Go to more ethical place.",-1

"988",2,"The good thing about the Braintree Red Line is that it doesn't stink nearly as badly as the Orange Line.  Otherwise the Red Line is notoriously unreliable at the worst times.  Pick the coldest snowiest day of the year and there are always delays, always a break down.  You may board the train at a stop where there is shelter only to be herded off into the open elements at the next stop as you wait to crowd in to the next train.  I've lived all over the greater Boston area and had to rely on almost every line except the Blue.  Hands down the Green Line is worse than the Red, but on no other line have I had the displeasure to rub elbows with some of the rudest people I've ever seen.  It's something about the South Shore.  That shopworn trick of pretending to be asleep in your seat while the elderly and the mobility impaired bobble about in front of you is legend on this line.  The decline of civilization is in evidence here moreso than any other place I've lived.",-1
"989",2,"I have been to Symphony 8 several times now and enjoy the atmosphere and and some of the staff - Brian, a manager, is a particularly good guy. The drinks have been pretty tasty and reasonably priced, but the food I had on Sunday was one of the worst dishes I have EVER eaten.

Living in the Symphony neighborhood for over 6 years, I am supremely bent that Tiger Lily no longer exists. It was the best place around for cheap drinks and completely underrated food. That said it took me a while to try the place that took over the space and even longer to try the food.

My girlfriend had the Pesto Goat cheese Crusted Salmon, which was seriously misnamed. It was a rather small portion of salmon with a dollop of goat cheese and a couple of green flecks that they call pesto served with three small spears of underseasoned asparagus and a small ice cream scoop of mashed potato. It was underwhelming but edible.

My Shepard's Pie, however was not fit to be fed to a dog. I am pretty sure they mixed Hormel ""no beans"" chili with canned corn, peas, and carrot. IT WAS HORRIBLE!!! At least it made me feel sick and gave me the runs. My immediate reaction was take some pride in your food - PLEASE. I will try other dishes to be fair, but for your own sake please do not not subject yourself to the atrocity that they call Shepherd's Pie.",-1
"990",2,"Very old building with wall paper falling off the wall. Not exactly clean. It was about 8pm and we asked for breakfast menus.

Contacted grub hub and they said yes they do- they contract a 3rd party to do their deliveries. How do you not know that if you work there?? They said it would only be 10 more mins. Half an hour later- contacted grub hub again as it had now been over 2.5 hours since we ordered. Turns out zen had never put in the order. Got a refund. Never ordering from this place again (or grubhub for that matter).",-1
"993",2,"This is probably my 8th or 9th time going back to Eldo. Unfortunately, my recent experience was rather disappointing. I was five minutes late to my appointment due to a family emergency, and I was certainly reminded of it the second I walked in the door. I got yelled at by Rachel in a very unprofessional manner and certainly was not given the opportunity to explain myself after I had apologized. It's awkward enough to get a Brazilian even if it's someone you have been to a few times, I felt even more uncomfortable during the session after getting screamed at. I should have walked right out but I stuck around and also tipped her generously regardless of what happened. Hopefully, this is a one-off situation and doesn't happen to anyone else in the future.This type of abusive behavior is totally unacceptable and I am pretty sure I can find other waxing businesses where they are nice, personable and make you feel comfortable without being rude to their customers. Needless to say, I will not be returning here nor will I be recommending this place to anyone.",-1
"994",2,"I almost feel bad giving them two stars, given it seems that they were having an off-night. But how can you be so off your game on New Years Eve? I was so excited for this place too, being a wine lover.

Over 20 minutes in between courses. Seated 45 mintues after our reservation time. So much more that it's not even worth listing because I don't want to be an ass. The maitre'd was apologetic, comped us wine, and I'll probably be back to give their happy hour a shot. That particular menu looks great, and I don't want to judge the restaurant on one night of crap with a pre fixe menu.

What I was curious about, is that why you would be understaffed and having issues with the kitchen on one of the most important nights of the year?? Someone call in sick? Call another employee. Testing out a new sous chef? Maybe on some other night, where people's chief celebration plans rely on a nice dinner/night out.

Oh, and I was aboslutey starved when we left, after our 2.5 hour ordeal. Like, ""I need to stop at Taco Bell and I don't even eat fast food"" starved. $71, and still starving.

"995",1,"These people are just terrible. We come to Disney and universal once a year, so when I saw how cheap the universal tickets were I decided to come do a tour since I would buy if the place was nice enough. They told me it would start at 7:30, woke up super early, got there in time. Waited for 50 minutes before someone came to us. Said we had to eat while they asked us questions. Food was nasty, but the agent we were stuck with made it even worse. Such a poor attitude. Asked us the same exact questions over and over and over again. 9:20 and your still didn't start. Idk if the real estate agent they were using was new or just not smart or whatever, but long story short, I paid extra money for our tickets and just left. If you are interested in this place to actually buy a time share, plan on spending your entire day there. Or, if you want cheap universal tickets--book the tour and pay for your tickets on the phone and then just tell them you changed your mind and pay the rest of the price. You'll end up getting universal tickets for 7 days for the same as you would pay at universal for 2 days. Never really saw the property, but if it's anything like the people they hire to represent them, then you shouldn't even bother. Poor experience (to put it mildly).  Also, I'm a single mother, and I make more than enough to pay for more than one time share there without an issue, but they had a real problem with the fact that I wasn't married...until I told her how much I made. Super insulted.


So then they send me a totally empty email response to my complaint. They did not want to give me the tour because I am a single mother. Period. This nasty woman walked away and refused to give us the tour.  I would have potentially purchased a time share (I am certain my income is more than most of the people I saw there doing the tour). They made it clear that they cater to ""families"" -- I guess me and my daughter don't qualify as a ""family"" which is highly insulting. Furthermore, the day before when I booked it, the associate told me it would be a 90 minute presentation and that if I did decide to buy, that they would give me the paperwork for me to review. I was there from 7:39-8:45 and she refused to even start the tour.  The girl on the phone said 7:30-9. Wasted my time. Wasted my child's time. Wasted my boyfriends time. Insulted my family. Who are you people to say that my daughter and I are not a family??? I guess that's why they are their own time share group--none of the other major companies want to be affiliated with a property like this with such poor values and respect for customers. This person told us she needed her time to show us the property and didn't want to be rushed after they had us waiting around for her for 45 minutes and then kept asking us the same questions over and over and consistently left our table to go do lord knows what.

I've been to some amazing vintage game stores throughout the US and Japan, but this one was not organized but also dirty.  many of the titles I was looking at seemed to have near mint pricing for Japanese imports with damaged boxes.  

the collector toy selection was abysmal as well with what seemed to be some water damaged packages, still demanding top market dollar for something that could have been marked down much cheaper at a comic con or other collector convention. 

the worst was coming in to look for a couple out of print PS2 games and seeing they had a stack of discs laying loose on the countertop in a jumbled order. needless to say--they couldn't find it, but I don't think I would have bought it if they could have.

The goat cheese was clearly the standout -- the tuna smelled like it had been frozen, and it was oddly paired with a warm corn garnish. The calamari was basic, nothing special.

Suggested improvements: get the espresso machine working, and get a juicer for grapefruit & orange juice.",1
"1006",5,"Great selection of bikes, clothing and accessories.  They have patient staff that will take the time to find you the right bike for you and your riding desires.  Prices are very competitive and when you purchase a bike you get tune ups for life.  The store has good hours,, easy parking and if the bike you want is not in stock they can order it an assemble it in a matter of a few days.",1
"1007",5,"I came here because someone requested it. But they requested the other locations. This was closer so I gave it a try. I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza but had blue cheese added. Let me tell you!!! GREAT SLICE OF PIZZA!  Take my word for it. I have a pizza slice tattooed on me. The blue cheese doesn't come on the pizza, it comes with ranch; but even that was delicious.  Come here for a good slice of pizza. 
In addition to the pizza I also order a caprese sub and had chicken added. Not on the menu once again but Delicious. 

Staff was also super nice and accommodating to my orders that weren't on the menu.",1
"1008",5,"Great food and service. If you're new to Ethiopian food they have a straight forward and easy to understand menu. I got the meat lovers tibs with lamb, beef, and tilapia. Everything tasted great.",1
"1009",5,"Such a fun place, especially in the spring.  This is your destination for hanging out/studying/relaxing in a beautiful park-like setting near a majority of your classes.",1
"1010",5,"Fabulous and elegant. Food was superb, especially with the wine parings. The chef even came around to ask how we liked our meals. Exceptional service! View of the sun set well worth the price of the meal...The dessert sampler plate was scrummy!",1

This is the place to go for cookies.  And more.  Terrific owners who use part of their profits to support a woman's shelter.  Go there, you will not be sorry.",1
"1012",4,"Good to see a local bar can evolve with the neighborhood. 

When Red Flag opened around five years ago, it was like the ""He-Man Woman Haters Club"" right out of the Little Rascals series of the 1930's; you almost had to beg women to go there. It was small, claustrophobic little hallway with a bar in it. 

Now, its expanded and some of the coolest people in town are there on any given night of the week. One of the best bartenders in Portland works at Red Flag, too. Give 'em another shot! They just hired a slew of new bartenders and they are good people. 

Don't ask anyone to make food there, however. They don't want to do it and will discourage you from ordering. Red Flag views itself as the place you go to after having had a late-lunch or dinner. Go easy on the 'tenders, they just want to mix drink right now. 

Across the way, Spints makes a life-changing chicken pot-pie!",1
"1013",5,"We love coming here. The view is great from the bar, the service is great. Sean at the bar had me taste a couple different wines before deciding. And the food is consistent, always good. Especially crispy Asian chicken bites.

Happy to report that Headwaters have found their... uh, River Legs! In the past few months I've been in a number of times, and am always delighted to stick around. The atmosphere has been ""broken in"" - still a mix of hotel guests and pre- and post-show folks from nearby theatres, but now that the bar staff have found their groove, it's once again a delightful downtown spot for a drink, or several. Brandy and Mitchell are tops.. and the Kippered Salmon (with an addictive herring spread) is delightful!",1
"1016",4,"We recently hosted my husband's 40th birthday at Vine Brook Tavern and we had an absolute blast! We utilized the upstairs front space for the event and it worked out perfectly - great space, nice size and the food/drink were incredible. All of our guests were super impressed and raving about everything and the Vine Brook staff, especially Juliette, Jeff and Lindsay, were so flexible and easy to work with.We will definitely host another event with them in the future - it couldn't have been a more positive experience.",1
"1017",5,"Pretty hip spot in the very walkable downtown Westerville area.  I love downtown Westerville. It is safe, easy to get around and has preserved a lot of the old buildings. Also, it isn't full of awful chains.

Enjoyed a beer sampler with a friend. Although it is a little loud, which is the modern thing for bars, I was still able to hold a conversation. I have heard the food is good but only had beers this time out. Neat backyard patio and convenient parking as well.",1

"1020",5,"I had the pleasure of going 4/29/17. For a $35 foot massage I did not expect to get the service I received. I LOVED IT.  It was very much relaxing and well worth the money that you are spending. I swear this man cracked everything from my feet to my neck. The only thing that I would suggest is to look into private rooms for you foot reflexology. I think customers would appreciate more privacy especially if you are with your significant other. Please go and check them out. I will be back!!",1
"1021",4,"Stopped here on a weekend boat ride for some drinks & apps.  We were an 8 person group. Two separate SERVICE comments.  1) The hostess: She was friendly enough, but absolutely pounding home all of the policies from the first moment.  (Are you all here?  Are you here for dinner or just drinks?, etc.)  I'm fine with this and understand turnaround for a busy seasonal restaurant like this.  HOWEVER, it was 3:15pm; the place was empty, and we were only going to be around 30 minutes as we had to leave with the tide.  She kept telling me how busy it gets around 6pm. This comment did not apply to us.  She would not seat us outside despite multiple requests to do so.  The kids were eating dinner, and the adults just apps.  So, I would give the hostess 1 out of 5 stars for making us feel unwelcome, and for being 0% flexible and making each customer feel like the only customer.  
2) The waitress:  She had a smile from ear to ear from the first moment, and moved us to outside.  ""Come here guys: I'll take care of you....etc.""  She was originally from Jersey, and was our key to having a great experience.  Simply put she was a 'yes' person compared to the 'no' person we first experienced.  Because of her we will be back.

FOOD:
Had grilled peppers, fried clams strips and fried calamari.  All were very good.  Not a 10, but a solid 8/ 8.5.  Drinks were delish and included fresh herbs grown on-site.",1
"1022",4,"YES! Love this place. Mainly because I am addicted to the mini wine gums or jewels or whatever they call them. They are teeny tiny little so i can eat more and it doesn't count! Hazaah!! But seriously, this place is gold. Outside Costco great prices on kitchen staples in bulk such as grains, spices, flour, pastas, sugar and then of course...candy! Oh and Callebaut chocolate in various forms in bulk!!! Shazaam!

So my suggestion to you is to go to the free wine tasting offered up at the Village VQA  next door every saturday from 3-5 (waZoooo!), get your buzz on then enjoy the Weigh To Go ride.",1
"1023",4,"I love coming here to get a burrito bowl because it lasts me two meals. The guac is really salty but we don't have to pay extra so I can't complain. Their burritos aren't the best because the contents don't mix together and tend to stay on one side. Tacos and salad are good but not worth the price. Queso sauce is not worth the hype--it's salty and its flavor dominates the dish. This food is more authentically Mexican then Chipotle.",1
"1024",4,"Not the cleanest Safeway I've been to but great wine selection. The bread pudding that is sold in the bakery is amazing. Also at 8:00 pm the deli sells any unsold of there heated food for 50% off. There's also a Starbucks inside the store so you can get your coffee on while shopping for coffee. 

The staff is very helpful, friendly, and fairly knowledgable. 

Avocados are currently .99 each.",1
"1025",4,"This a local Mexican style small restaurant. Great tacos my boyfriend tried. Kind of gave me a Torchy's themed restaurant. Queso and guacamole was great. Had an IPC beer, it's an acquired taste. The coconut margarita topped with salt was amazing and I don't like coconut but my boyfriend got it, no frozen margarita here but on the rocks are just as great here. Service was very fast and we were sat fairly fast, it was busy when we arrived. There is balcony available.",1
"1026",4,"Great food and great service! Authentic feel, too. I had the vaca frita and the croquetas de jamon and they were both delicious (a bit different style than the Spanish croquetas which I'm used to). Didn't taste these myself but I've been told the Yucca fries, the ropa vieja, and the Cubano sandwich are also very recommendable.",1
"1027",5,"Love love love M.Miller. Mark and Alan are wonderful and their knowledge of materials, fit, style and size is unsurpassed. Never a hard sell, and the pricing is more than fair given the superior quality of the clothing. I get compliments evey time I wear my M.Miller ski outfits, from Vermont to Wyoming!
Thank you for your gorgeous products!",1
"1028",5,"Upon entering Crisper's I received a friendly greeting and an explanation of how the restaurant worked. I proceeded to have a look at the menu, ordered and found a seat. The diner was very clean and cheerful.

I ordered a delicious Greek salad. The busboy was extremely nice and brought my order to my table. When I finished he swept up my plate, etc., allowing the diners a simple exit.

My favorite thing about Crispers, with their salads at least, is that they mix it up well when it's served; this way I don't have to shuffle the salad myself and worry about spilling an olive over the edge of the plate. = ) The salads are ready to eat; no mixing required!",1
"1029",4,"We had a nice quiet dinner on Sunday night - the decor is lovely with lots of presumably Nepali artifacts.  We sat at the booths - and on both sides the seats move (please fix them to the floor as it is very disruptive to have your neighbor get up and you be forced forward into the table!).  

The offered soy beans - crunchy with garlic and fresh ginger - were delicious and a good insight into the spicy tasty food to come.  We were blown away by the Kwatti bean soup - definitely had the promised variety of beans but the spicing was unusual and delicious.  The veggie momos were super tasty and the spicy tomato sauce as well.  The Aloo Achar was disappointing - potato salad with onions and peas but no evidence of the sesame seeds and nothing special.  

We tried the goat curry, which had tasty chunks of goat in a yummy sauce, and the veggie curry, which had a variety of veggies in a delicious sauce.  Overall, the flavors were interesting and intense, spicy but not unbearable, and definitely fresh.  Service was fine and the wine selection good.  

The special spiced yougurt dessert was not too much and refreshing.  

A wonderful find - and definitely worth a trip back and recommendations to friends/family.",1
"1030",5,"We went for a birthday dinner on Easter and found that there was only a buffet option because it was Easter.  It turned out that we were VERY lucky that this was when we went. It was wonderful. The service was attentive but not hovering   The food on the buffer was very good and certainly not the usual buffet food. All items were from their menu. It was fun to try things we might not have tried otherwise. They also had small plates of other options from their menu. These were great too. We will be back for sure.",1
"1031",4,"OK. Get the Crab Benedict. The crab cakes are giant, delicious, crabby,...and the hollandaise sauce is perfection. Its served with potatoes cooked perfectly. This is my go to spot, this is my go to order. DO NOT BE ALARMED if your poached eggs have a slightly purple hue. They use red wine vinegar in the poaching water...too lazy to use the white vinegar, I guess? This is a practice that should immediately be stopped due to the slightly gross look of pale, purple/pink poached eggs (say that 10 times), but I'll still eat them forever if they don't. They are that good.",1
"1032",5,"Fabulous - Bring a friend because portions are huge.   Ordered were vegetarian meals: a veggie wrap and fattoush (salad).    Before the wrap I was served zaatar with warm homemade pita - both so delicious I can't even describe them.   The veggie wrap was two wraps actually, enough for two people.   The fattoush was taken out because there was so much to eat.   Also try the rose water to drink - sweet, iced, delicious.    It was quiet when I was there, so service was perfect, the waiter (possibly an owner) was so cordial, the restaurant is very clean with tablecloths on the tables and cloth napkins.    I would definitely recommend Fairouz to enjoy Lebanese cuisine but if not familiar, there are other dishes such as kabobs, pizza and salads.   So glad I found Fairouz.",1
"1033",5,"Paula did the makeup for my wedding in June 2009.  She was absolutely wonderful to work with and made my mom and I look stunning!  Her prices were very reasonable too.  We did the trial in the shop a month or so before the wedding and on my wedding day she came to the Back Bay and did our makeup in the bridal suite. The best part was the makeup was very classy and lasted all night.  It was a pleasure to have her around that day and she was another proud woman in the room with us.  If you are getting married in the Boston area you should definitely go in and speak with Paula.",1

The room was very clean, the workout facilities was nice (and included free-weights), and the hotel bar was very cool.

The staff and service was great!

The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it doesn't come with free Wifi.  It seems like a hotel in this price range should include complementary internet service.",1

"1037",5,"Our experience at Coquine was outstanding.  We chose the four-course Chef's Choice menu and wine pairing and were highly impressed!  I especially appreciated their attention to detail in everything from the menu to the service. 

The flavors were amazing and they were able to easily accommodate my husband's shellfish allergy, which we greatly appreciated. 

The service was just what we had hoped for - we got to learn about the wines we were drinking and the food seemed to come out at a good pace for us.  I can't remember how many people actually helped us, but there were quite a few!  We felt well cared for and never rushed.  

They started us with appetizers that were not on the menu which was such a nice touch. And when we got to select our dessert from a tray of delicacies, I was completely sold that this is a place we will be sure to revisit!  Quite a gem right at the base of Mt. Tabor - we highly recommend this place.",1

"1040",5,"I've really just never been disappointed by this place. 

Today was the first time I've actually went and picked up my food (my sister normally gets our orders) I like the overall vibe of the establishment, it's nice & different. The food is soooooo amazing!!!!!!!! When you read the ingredients you might question the combination but you never regret it once you've taken a bite, OH MY GOODNESS, so yummy.

My favorite meal there is the jerk salmon wrap, it has mango salsa, sweet plantains, cranberry, jerk salmon with a combination sauce, has a couple of other things that I have no idea what it is but AMAZING is what it is. I literally want to kiss the chef every single time, makes me so happy and so full, I haven't tried much of anything else to be fair except for a coconut shake that is also so bomb. I just love their food. 

The jerk isn't too spicy but then again I love spicy food so don't take my word for it... ENJOY!",1
"1041",5,"Best dessert spot in Portland. Best banana split in Portland. Best building in Portland. Good live music. Cool magic throughout the house. Romantic. Easy going.

"1042",4,"i came with a bachelor party before heading out for the night and had an amazing meal.  We sat in the small room upstairs, and thought we'd be by ourselves but there were a few other couples there.  I kinda felt bad for them cause there was about 15 of us and we were pretty loud.  The meal was a couple weeks ago, and i got hammered after so i don't remember everything we had, but i do remember the food being really good.  I know we had fried calamari and caprese salad which were great, and some kind of cheese and oil together to dip your bread in that i loved.  I went with the ravioli as my entree.  I'm pretty picky with italian food, especially marinara sauce, and this definitely passed the test.  It was a perfect al dente.  The size of the meal was perfect before a night of heavy drinking.  Before we left we drank a ton of limoncello and went through like 7 bottles of wine.  The bill only came out to $60 a person, and that was after paying for the bachelor, not bad at all in my opinion.",1
"1043",4,"Nice seating area , we were a party of 2 , so the table which was given to us was excellent , bread & butter in a Chinese restaurant is not usual at all , but you will find it here .

I had the crab cake sliders and they were flavorful and seasoned well.  Great job!",1

"1048",5,"I started coming to Lucas because I was tired of modern medicine. The medical industry just wanted to give me more medications and take more of my money without actually helping or correcting any of my issues. 

My wife and I decided to make a big change in our eating habits, exercise schedule and how we dealt with medical issues (homeopathic). With all the good that came with these changes we still had a few issues... I thought I had carpel tunnel in my right wrist and I couldn't sleep at night; I tried almost everything natural we could find to correct the problems but nothing seemed to be working. 

My Daughter was going to an Acupuncturist in Chicago to help with her migraines and she asked her for a referral in Austin, Texas. Lucas was recommended because they had studied acupuncture together! 

I was a bit skeptical at first because I didn't want to become a  pincushion... so I decided to let my wife try it first. After seeing how quickly it was improving her issues; I decided to give it a try. Lucas is amazing and really understanding! He walked me through the whole process and really helped me grasp his profession and eased any uncertainties I had. 

Every time I gave him a challenge he helped me correct it -  I cannot recommend Lucas enough!",1

There is not a ton of seating in this place and there are people standing everywhere so i would recommend taking your order to go. 

They have a decent selection of donuts (maybe 15-20 different donuts) and they are all very unique flavors. It's a bit on the pricey side for donuts, average maybe $3 - $4 a donut. We only got 2, the Creme Brulee and Apple Fritter. The Creme Brulee was super unique and very very good. The Apple Fritter was pretty average. Not worth the $3. 

I would go back again and get more variety so i can try the different flavors but i think this place is more of a trend or an Instagram picture to check off the list.",1
"1050",5,"I've been going to Hearth regularly pretty much since they've opened, and I'd have to say it's one of my 5 favorite pizza places in Atlanta.  If you're looking for a traditional Neopolitan pizza, Hearth is not your place. But if you're just looking for a stellar thin crust pizza, with some creative toppings, Hearth is the way to go. 

The 'Ring of Fire' is my favorite, but the 'Mass Pike' is up there as well, and the 'Shrimp and Goat Cheese' is a great ""different"" pizza. For a more simple pizza, the 'Queen's Right' is outstanding.",1
"1051",4,"I'm a sucker for pubs.  If a business has the word pub in it, I'm there.  I'm always reeled in by that mysterious force that makes me check out any food establishment with the name ""pub"" in it.  I dread driving past one called The Colonoscopy Pub.  No!  Well, um, erm, OK...

But seriously.  It's a decent enough typical suburban sports bar.  It's not really the type of place that I'd normally hang out in, but it's alright.  There's plenty of seating, seems like lots of regulars, everyone is pretty friendly.  Guinness in a can ( eh? ), at $4.75.  

There are plenty of big screens around to watch.  Add in Keno, a jukebox, pool table, patio and enough seating for about 80 or so.  I didn't try their food but previous reviews seem to think it's decent bar food.

Maybe again if I were in the area.",1
"1052",5,"I was very pleased to find among dog friendly spots in portland?  that this place is on the list.    so we loaded up the car with our two pooches, since we're on vacation....  and cannot leave them in the car, or in the room.  Picked up my elderly mother, and headed out.   

IT was a beautiful day, and our two doggies?   seemed pleased to sit and stare out at the river, and see boats and people pass by.   I was shocked that they just were so relaxed on the grass, and the waiter even brought them bowls of water and biscuits.   simply welcoming.

we ordered lunch.   beginning with the avocado mango crab tower.   wow.   then proceeded with some wine, and then salads, and entrees.   I was in heaven eating fresh seafood outside, and it was sunny.   afterall, portland my old hometown?  isn't always that nice out, but today?  was lovely.

my man had the andouille mac n cheese, my mom had the fish and chips, and I can't think of a better place to sit and talk about life and family.

meanwhile the doggies?  were enjoying themselves as well.

the only thing I didn't like?  was the bikes riding through.  If I was a waiter here I would be very concerned of getting knocked over.   I hope you can get rid of that aspect.   pretty rude if you ask me.  take your bikes someplace else.

"1053",4,"I never thought I'd find a parking lot that made getting into and out of the Burlington Mall look easy.  This is definitely a better place to go on a weekday rather than the weekend. But as a whole, the mall this store is in is worth it, and Nordstrom Rack is part of the reason.

When I first walked in, I was thinking ""Huh, upscale Marshalls.""  Well, that's right in the sense of how it's organized. But actually it's better organized - and you'd expect that here. The deals on Nordstrom-quality goods ranged from good to really good. In the men's section, I particularly liked how well things were spread out by size. 

The cashiers are extremely friendly and professional as well - again, exactly as you would expect.",1
"1054",5,"On the Charles you can't be sure of much. The wind is fickle and the weather unpredictable. This might cause worry to some sailing programs, after-all wind is kind-of important for sailing. But, at Community Boating the good times don't depend on the weather. Last summer the weather at CBI was all over the place. We had more than our fair share of sunny days with great wind, where you could watch the Sonars and Rhodes 19s skim from bridge to bridge. But not all of the days can be perfect. There were days without any wind and, the most dreaded of all, the rainy days. But it didn't seem to matter. If you came to CBI on a perfect day and then came back on a windless day, you would see the same number of smiles. The activities are extremely varied so there's always something fun to do.  When the wind is great, the Mercuries and Windsurfers dot the Charles. When the wind is nowhere to be found, it is the perfect day for the, ""Great Kayak Adventure"" or just hanging on the hyper-dock. Even when its rainy and sailing is all but impossible, there are activities. The indoor teaching facilities are perfect for foul weather days. Here you can learn the basics, master the racing technique, or learn how to fly a spinnaker properly. I have been teaching here for a couple of years and it is the most incredible program ever!!!!        Community Boating is really great. Any kid can sign up for the entire summer ofr just a dollar and get full access to lessons and everything. Adult memberships are only 150 dollars for access to the entire place for the entire year. Windsurfers, kayaks, hundreds of sailboats. This place is the most unbelievable asset to boston!!!",1

The beer list is phenomenal.  You will not be able to find any of those beers anywhere else in Malden.  Menu has a lot of great choices.  We had to start with the buffalo chicken dip, served with fresh tortilla chips.  The burger I had was cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.  Instead of fries, I got a side of broccoli with it to be healthier.

Our server, Mary, was spectacular.  She was knowledgeable about the beer list and very friendly.

"1060",5,"I love this little place! Tucked away under the Wexner Art Museum, they consistently put out great food. The atmosphere is fun (there are usually professors meeting with colleagues, some graduate students working while downing tons of coffee, etc. but not packed with undergrads) and everything I've tried so far has been delicious. The Quinoa Salad with chicken sounds very simple, but somehow is one of the best salads I've EVER had! I love that you can get breakfast all day -- I had an egg sandwich with vegan sausage for lunch the other day and it was great! I'm not vegan, but i definitely recommend trying that sausage. Their desserts are AMAZING. I bought one to share with a friend, but it happened to disappear before I got back to my office...

It's easy to access as an OSU student, but I don't know how parking would be for someone not affiliated with the university. Regardless, it would certainly be worth the trip!",1

"1062",5,"Ok, I'll admit that I'm a lesbian who hates gay bars.  and gay coffee shops.  and gay bookstores...and...My friend and I decided to check this place out and I was so pleasantly surprised!  The adorable cowboy bartender called me ""darlin"".  There were lovely ladies to ogle.  The dancing was a fantastic mix of impressive, hilarious and oh so sexy.  The beer was cheap.  Then I went outside!  Dance music which isn't my fave, but still a good mix.  I was lucky and scored a couch where I could creepily people watch to my heart's content. Everyone was friendly and having a hell of a time.  Nice mix of men and women, young and old, straight and gay.  My friends and I closed the bar....for the first time in many years.  The bad news...while waiting in line for the bathroom, some unfortunate soul had to barf and kept asking her ""friends"" to turn on the water to drown out the yakking.  The ""friends"" couldn't stop laughing or telling me in detail what was going down (as though I didn't know!) long enough to do so. oh to be young again.  I was complimented TWICE which made me so happy.  So what one was by the drunken unsympathetic ""friend"" of the yakker and the other was a totally drunk gay dude.  He said ""you're pretty"".  His friend said ""don't mind him, he's drunk""  I said ""I don't care, I'll take it"".  Hooray!",1
"1063",4,"Finally got around to trying Fat Boys since I'm a huge bbq fan! The menu here is quite big! I ordered the bbq sliced beef lunch plate, it comes with 2 sides and 2 pieces of garlic bread, I got the Mac and cheese and coleslaw. Both sides as well as the garlic bread were tasty. The beef was slightly pink, and mostly tender. Hubby had the bbq sliced pork lunch plate. His pork was tender and juicy and as sides he had fries (BORING) and beans, the beans are meaty and almost like a chilli! The table provides 3 types of bbq sauce; sweet, mild and hot. All were good, the mild was a little vinegary for my taste though. So overall this place is good, at least worth putting in the BBQ rotation. Also they serve breakfast till 11am!!!",1
"1064",5,"Good selection of wine and beer.  Food is very different from tavern food.  Delicious.",1
"1065",5,"We went out for a Saturday dinner-date last night at this restaurant, which we'd heard nice things about. Just a 5 minute drive from Harvard Square, it was cozy and informal, and reminded me of Italian restaurants in smaller towns and cities there, such and Parma. 

The owner actually came over, took our order, and served us. That was a nice treat. He's from Napoli, and he was extremely accommodating. I spotted a man at a table on the other side of the room eating what turned out to be a squid-ink pasta with seafood. We managed to snag the very last one available after the owner rushed over to put the order in. 

We had an excellent cheese, prosciutto and figs anti-paste; squid-ink pasta; and hanger steak with Brussels sprouts and potatoes. A great added thing was they split the pasta and steak into two small dishes for us. For dessert with had chocolate tort with hazelnut gelato, and a tiramisu. 

Squid ink seafood pasta with shrimps was the best. Hanger steak was very good. The ambience was laid back and comfy. 

Overall, an authentic Italian eatery without any pretentiousness whatsoever. A gem, just as it was said to be. We'll be returning soon. But please don't go! Or don't tell too many folks if you do. A gem like this deserves to remain half secret. ;)",1
"1066",4,"Viceroy is one of our favorite regular restaurants.  The wait staff are attentive and the food consistently good.  The level of spice is just right.  We really like the vegetarian appetizer of pakoras and samosas.  Our favorite entrees are rogan josh, chicken sag, dal tarka, and an okra entree. When we go there we often see Indian families also dining there.",1
"1067",5,"This place is not to be missed! My two girlfriends and I loved our massages. This is a first...we all loved the experience and thought our therapists were amazing.  I will make sure to get time there every time I come to visit Portland.",1
"1068",5,"This place is brilliant. The decor is fantastic. The food is tender and delicious. The service is fast, friendly, and welcoming. And sitting on the floor in the left room in the tent like setting brought back memories of life in the middle east. (sitting in the floor is for those with an open mind, who want to experience how the majority of the world dines. If you think eating in the floor is weird or bad, go to the room in the right)

GET THE AFGHAN TEA (add two pieces of sugar) and taste bliss.",1
"1069",5,"Theresa was knowledgeable, transparent, and patient during the entire buying process. She empowered us with resources and tools, and we never felt pressured to settle or decide before we were ready. She listened to our hopes and our concerns, and we had total confidence in her honesty and her ability to represent us during all stages. She and her team know Portland. So very glad our family had the opportunity to work with them, and we highly recommend their services! 

PS- We are in love with our new home!",1
"1070",5,"Amazing donuts.  I think my favorite is actually still the OG.  There is something special about a donut without the bells and whistles, since simple flavors are rarely that simple.  There is a perfect chew to each bite, and a perfect amount of sweetness.

The passion fruit, and blueberry bourbon are also delectable.  The line goes pretty quick, and if you are just getting a few of the regular flavors, you don't have to wait long.",1
"1071",4,"Nice atmosphere and great selection of wines.  Nice alfresco seating.  Kitchen a bit slow, but food was good.  Portions are tapas-sized, so best to order 3 items for 2 people. Great happy hour deals until 7.",1
"1072",5,"I really like these noodles. Noodles are a great thing, especially in chicken broth. It's like chicken.... But noodles. Price is fair. Quantity is fair. But I rated it 5 stars out of 5 stars because Yum. Yum Yum Yum.  

The tea is nice.  Water is free. My friend got a coke.",1
"1073",4,"Best lobster tail I've ever had.  When they overcooked the steak, they worked tirelessly to fix it and were extremely hands-on in an effort to make me happy.  Made me like the experience even more.",1
"1074",5,"omg.... This place was FUCKING AMAZING. I can't believe for their prices how good the food was. The reviews are definitely right, this place is soooo good. Definitely reccomend eating here!! Had the snow crab and it was so much fun breaking that shit open!",1
"1075",4,"We have tried this place twice and had a good experience both times. First time we dined in and enjoyed the vegetarian platter app, pista coconut naan, garlic naan, paneer kadai, and chicken balti with mushroom. All dishes were tasty and portion sizes were large. The complimentary lentil papadan was crispy and we loved the trio of sauces that were offered with the meal. The mint sauce was nice and fresh, the tamarind had good flavor, and the onion salsa was spicy. We left feeling full and I even had enough leftovers for another meal. 

About a month later (today), we ordered takeout via yelp. Similar order as first time but we also got masala dosa. Very quick and easy process. The food took about 20 minutes to prepare. Wonderful flavors! The buffet looked well stocked and smelled great when I went in to pick up. 

Next time we will try that!",1
"1076",4,"Definitely a fan. We tried both the chicken and lamb tibs, with gomen, cabbage, and several other dishes, along with the gomen dip. It was all both interesting and very good. The gomen dip was especially good, but I liked all of the flavors that I tried. The service was great and we will be back to try some other things.",1
"1077",5,"Excellent, excellent, excellent!

Recently my aunt took my brother, his wife, and me to Dumpling Palace for a mid-evening dinner after an afternoon at the Museum of Fine Arts.  Dumpling Palace was very crowded when we came in, and the waitstaff were working very hard.  However, they were still very friendly and courteous.  I had a really wonderful ""first impression.""  Our waiter took the time to make sure that we understood what (and how much) each menu item contained and that we got what we wanted.  All our dishes were just as we expected them to be, which means, excellent.  We had no complaints about anything during our meal.

There are some caveats about coming to Dumpling Palace (though I will not deduct any stars, since it's not the restaurant's fault):

1.  Our party of four got a table rather quickly, but the restaurant was very crowded (even at 8:30 PM on a Wednesday), and there was a party of five still waiting in line in the entranceway.  If you have a large party, you would do well to make a reservation in advance.

2.  Dumpling Palace (and nearby restaurants) are best for parties in which no one drives, since parking in this area is extremely hard to find.  And if you do find a space before 8 PM, you will need a lot of quarters for the parking meter.

3.  If you come around 6 PM or earlier, there is a two-hour limit on parking.  Since dinners (including wait-time) frequently run over two hours, I do not recommend eating in this part of town until well after 6 PM (at least, not unless everyone arrives by walking or by public transportation).

Sorry about all the negatives.  The fault lies in Boston's parking regulations, not Dumpling Palace.  As far as Dumpling Palace itself is concerned, everything is excellent, excellent, excellent!",1
"1078",4,"Pretty sweet spot to hang out and read.  Lots of space to sit and spots to charge your phone.  I'm not gonan lie, I came here to get out of the cold while waiting for nearby garage to finish work on my friend's car.  There were lots of new books and graphic novels.  Killed a ton of time while reading graphic novels. I walked around and saw a lot of new books they got in in the front, and there were lots.",1
"1079",4,"Man, when the Red Sox are in the playoffs, and they are about two games from making the World Series, this is the place. It's one of the establishments that make you realize why Boston sports are so exciting to watch in Boston.

Decent beer selection and a good food selection. Not only is this place a great night spot, but you can pop in for a great lunch as well. The service is excellent, even when it's packed to the gills so you shouldn't expect a problem.

Be mindful, as Boston is a college town, lots of people are out on a Friday and Saturday night and the place gets packed, people get drunk, and things can get rowdy. I've witnessed a few scuffles while a student in Boston, but it always makes for a good time as long as you're not involved.

All in all, I like this place a lot. If you're gonna watch the Sox, or just about any NFL team on gameday, you can expect you'll be able to get it on one of their many TVs if you want it.

Enjoy!",1
"1080",5,"I'm not the biggest fan of high pressure sales situations likely because I might accidentally walk away with a new car.  I could likely be congratulatory in that I made it to this age with never once buying a new car.  My roommate found it endearing that this is my first car with a rear window wiper.  And a CD player, if I'm being truthful.

That said, you may realize I need babying and hand holding to spend large amounts of money.  It could be that it was a slow day or that I had previously set up an appointment, but I got lots of one on one treatment and even time alone to text all my friends to ask them their thoughts.  I test drove a few cars after overly researching minis and drove a fiat to boot and I was sold.  I'm very happy with the sales team who took the time to show me numerous cars that might fit my needs but also my personality.  Fallon was very personable and understanding of my needs and foibles.  I can't wait to have time to take my new car for a scenic ride around Oregon asap!",1
"1081",5,"Best gyro I've ever had, period - Thanks to yelp for helping us find this place because we would have never just happened to walk by it. This is simply legit, and even if you are not a big fan of Greek food, this place may just change your perspective on things....Try the original, it was unfathomably delicious.",1
"1082",5,"I don't normally write reviews on Yelp and I think most people only review if they have an absolutely amazing experience or something goes terribly wrong. 

This is an example of an absolutely amazing experience! I moved to the north end a few months ago and read some other great reviews. I went to My Cousins Place for some Sunday Hangover food and go back almost every weekend now. Everything is amazing but in particular I have to call out the coast guard sandwich which is like thanksgiving anytime you feel a little homesick! 

The iced coffees are also the best I have ever had and even worth it when it's below freezing outside. 

The cousins that run the place are super friendly and make everything completely fresh for you. It's a bit of a greasy spoon but don't let the modest appearance fool you, it's a genuine gem of the north end!",1
"1083",5,"This is a great place for a lazy night out. I hv not seen a bad headliner here yet. Feature acts are good too. We hv come to be regulars at this club and they send out free tickets every so often which is nice. 
Plenty of parking around. Food and drinks are better than average which is good for a comedy club. I highly recommend HCC to anyone who likes stand up",1
"1084",5,"In town on business came here after we tried another place and left. Our server was named Vee and she took care of us amazingly well.

The food was excellent. My partner had the shepards pie. It was amazing.  I had the bangers and mashed. Out of this world. The mac n cheese was unbelievable and the clan chowder was the bomb. 

Give this place a try you will not be disappointed.",1
"1085",4,"Love this place. The good wolf burrito so good. The atmosphere is not your average Mexican place have more a arty feel to it!",1

"1087",4,"You know how they say so-and-so is ""pound for pound"" the toughest fighter in the UFC? Well, King's Cuisine is the equivalent of that for dim sum. Dollar for dollar, it's some of the best value dim sum you can get in Vancouver.

The shrimp dumpling (ha gao) and pork dumpling (siu mai) are excellent. And while the menu is a bit lacking in specialty items, it has all the expected things (rice noodles, spare ribs, clay pot rice, fried noodles, etc). It also has a few things I especially like: the fried eggplant with shrimp paste here is my favorite.

Moreover, you absolutely cannot beat the prices. Small, medium, large and chef's special items are all under $3. Even the most special items are under $6. You can easily eat a whole meal for under $8 a person.

Now, the interior is a bit shabby looking and the furnishings and decor are not the newest, so if you're looking for an upscale place then this isn't the place for you. The parking is also only available on the street or in the nearby neighborhood (rear parking is tight too) so it's not the most accessible. But these things are minor relative to how good the dim sum is and how cheap it is.

Overall? One of my favorites. It always has a spot in my lineup. If you're a fan of dim sum and don't want to break the bank, this place is for you.",1
"1088",4,"I am not ashamed to admit that I am a big fan of Maggiano's.  Admittedly, it is a mass produced version of Italian favorites, but the food is always reliably tasty and the portions are huge!

They offer many dishes in both half or full portions.  We've often found the whole size portions big enough to split for two and still had leftovers.

Favorites include the Chicken Francese with Roasted Red Potatoes and Baked Ziti with Sausage.  The mozzarella fritta makes for a great appetizer, albeit slightly bad for your waistline. :)

A few things to note:  DO NOT expect to show up on a Friday night and wait less than hour (or more) without reservations.  This place is always packed with locals, birthday parties and politicians alike.  If you do come sans reservation, they have a great lounge where you can have apps and drinks while waiting for your table.  More other restaurants should follow-suit.  Finally, you can sit at the bar first come, first serve with the same full menu.

Great food, reasonable prices and a great location equal a winning combo for me!",1
"1089",5,"Oh Summermoon, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways:
1. You always have exactly what I want and willingly go out of your way to modify my drink every time I ask. 
2. Your location is wonderful and the inside of your cafe makes me feel like  I'm important and quiet enough that I can get whatever I came to work on done, no problem. 
3. There are still just about the right amount of people who know about you that I don't have to share you with too many others. Shhh, you're my little secret. No, don't tell anybody else how incredible you are!
4. You have a phenomenal bean and creative secret ingredients that always keep me guessing. 
5. You're just my style and I'll always rave about you to my friends, even if they do start visiting you all the time, I can't help myself. You deserve all the positive attention you get. :)",1
"1090",5,"Workers showed up on time as scheduled. During the initial walk around  I mentioned an additional repair I needed and they included it with no additional cost. I felt a bit concerned that the additional repair took quite a bit of time that they weren't anticipated, but they completed all repairs and didn't increase the bill. 
I wouldn't expect them to do that routinely, and they may re-evaluate their costing procedures to accommodate these additional unscheduled repairs, but I am a happy recipient of their work. 
I will definitely call on them for any future work that might crop up. I highly recommend them!!",1
"1091",5,"It's pretty hard (ie: impossible) to find decent Korean food in Austin, let alone a fun place with a great staff, but College Roadhouse delivers all that and more.

When I initially moved here I went on a quest for tangsuyuk as that is basically my comfort food from back home. The only places I found that served it left much to be desired. At College Roadhouse it is served crispy and delicious. While it is not the most elaborate tangsuyuk I've tried, it is very, very good and is served with love. There's really no other place I would order this dish in ATX.

The KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) wings are SO, SO good. Have taken multiple friends here for those, and nobody has ever left disappointed. 

Delishous food, fair prices, generous portions, hottie Korean babes perpetually on the massive TVs: this place reminds me so much of the Korean food joints in Northern VA and I love it so much. The owners are so nice; they obviously take great pride in their amazing establishment.

At Blue Star I had a jelly filled Rhubarb/Strawberry sugar donut. This donut was the best donut I have ever had.  It was a perfect sour and tart mix, the donut batter wasn't heavy, the sugar somehow managed to stick to the donut and not flake off or stick to my fingers.  I prefer coco's glaze donut, but Blue Star had the best donut I had on my tour of portlands donuts. It was absolute perfection!",1

"1105",5,"Do they come in uninterrupted? Yes, but only once after that they asked if they could come when noticing the sour look on my face when they came uninterrupted. The property itself is beautiful, it was only slightly dirty due to people coming and going. I obviously didn't expect it to be impecable, I mean who has those expectations. The best part about my property- well there's four, one- it's next to the water, two-it's newly renovated, three-our yard is fully fenced with even a huge garden to grow stuff in and four, there's a plowing company that's comes and clears off the sidewalk! Give these realtors a chance, they have amazing places to offer and I can say I'm a happy camper. The ad I replied to on craigslist didn't even have pictures. I was so shocked when I saw it in person, it was love at first site. The person who posted about the dates being wrong, nobody is perfect- I had the same worries but everything turned out fine. We even got to move in 15 days early! No, I don't work there. David and his Assitant Sara were profesional and helpful along the way. They seem to always keep their cool while handling a huge clientele. Cut them some slack, they show apartments all day and most of the people don't even rent.

Escargot appetizer was perfect. The tenderest, most flavorful snails I ever eated. The sauce was buttery and delicious but the taste of the snails was prevalent.

The duck breast and confit was the best duck that my wife and I have ever had (with my possible exception of Wai Wai's). The lobster Savannah, while likely sacreligious in these parts, what with all the sauce, was incredible. It had better be for $60.

My dessert of Baked Alaska was awesome; an over-the-top mound of ice cream, and caramelized marshmallow, still in flames as it arrived at the table.

Service was attentive without being intrusive. The atmosphere is surprisingly relaxed, the room quiet, and did I mention how f*cking classy this sh*t is?

The prices are reasonable and the store is kept clean, and tidy. Also, the people running the laundromat are helpful and don't make you feel like a nusance for asking a question.

When we went through the checklist of what to have/not have we did the usual (photographer, cake, etc) but I said no to video. I couldn't imagine spending time watching my wedding video plus I'm the person who hides my face in the pillows during the scenes in romantic comedies when the nice guy gets kicked below the belt so I felt like all I'd do is want to skip past the parts of me. Turns out, I look great on camera (well thanks to some special editing!). 

While this may seem like something you can pass on, DON'T. It will become your favorite thing to sit and do as time passes.

It was so special to finally see what my Bridesmaids looked like walking down the aisle, to register the moment when my husband realized I was his WIFE and to see my father smile as he stood to give me away.

I tried the chicken shawarma combo with the additions of hummus and baba ganoush. I loved it. Biting into it, it was crispy from the grill but tender inside with the juicy meat, loaded with flavor. My fiance had the same combo but with the lamb. No complaints there! 

On the side, the falafel was light and fluffy. I found the curry flavor bold compared to others. We also took a side of hummus and pita to go. Their hummus is garlicky and delicious.

The restaurant is hidden behind 6th St. and is in a quiet area, contrasting with the typical douche parade on other parts of 6th.  The interior is spartan but breezy and the detail is placed on the presentation and preparation of the food, which is, to me, more important than trying to make a place look fancy but serving crapy food.

We had the grilled lobster cakes as an appetizer.  They were cooked well and the cilantro and chipotle aioli complimented them well.

For dinner my girlfriend had the green chile polenta, which she enjoyed, while I had the pepita redfish.  I've eaten redfish cooked a variety of ways across the gulf coast but the spiced crust and habenro butter made it very exotic and thoroughly enjoyable.  

I'd reccomend this place to anyone who's never had cuisine from the tropics, or to anyone who wanted to get some great food at a reasonable price.",1

"1121",5,"Amazing pizza and the staff is very friendly! The live the variety of Specialty pizzas that they off. I wish the place were bigger to dine in but other than that the food was great.",1
"1122",5,"I really like this theater because of how ornate and historic it is. I went here for Tufts Med School's White Coat Ceremony and then again for the Gay Men's Chorus performance so I haven't seen a play here. But even from the very top nosebleed seats you are close enough to the stage for it to not be distracting. Unless you get distracted by staring at the walls! The seats are really large and there is ample leg room so you never feel like you are encroaching on your neighbor's personal space. I recommend going to an event at the Cutler Majestic!",1
"1123",5,"Excellent bakery. The hostess is very nice and warm. The wife pastry tastes the same as those at home. Definitely will come for a second time.",1
"1124",4,"The Pad Thai is delicious as well as their steamed shumai. The sauce for the shumai is sweet and tasteful. However one time, i ordered the shumai and when they delivered it to my house the meat inside was still very raw and Perhaps they were too busy and didn't give it enough time to steam properly? But otherwise i never had an issue here. I used to have to travel all the way to canton to eat pad thai but now I found this place just a couple months ago and they're great! My advice though: no matter how busy you are, still try your best to deliver ""cooked"" meals and now raw ones. Still love this place though!",1
"1125",4,"On a cold and cloudy day, there is nothing better that sitting on the second floor of this establishment eating warm soup while you look out the window. 

I give it four stars because though the food is typical of Thai restaurant cuisine, the lunch offers a lovely array of small-portioned dishes for those not on a student budget.",1
"1126",4,"Husband went here for a mid-day snack. Willy's has always been a go-to meal for him, the overall taste and customer service was the same as other locations. He had the adobe chicken bowl. 

The negatives: the price is a bit more than a non-airport location. In addition, chips and salsa are also an extra charge.

Luckily for my husband the cashier gave him chips on the house.",1
"1127",5,"Love this place!  Their salsas are amazing. The avocado margarita is to die for... Sorry for the half eaten salsa sampler and half drink margarita!  you won't regret coming to this colorful hopping place because the food and drinks are wonderful!",1
"1128",5,"Came here for happy hour during our break from Disney world. (Alcohol is important when you're surrounded by a lot of loud kids). The BF and I sat at the bar - the bartender was very helpful and friendly. We ordered nachos to share and I am glad we only got one order - the nachos were ginormous! Not only was it huge but it was delicious! They were definitely one of the best nachos I've had. Moreover, the delicious drinks were the cherry on top.",1
"1129",4,"We got delivery from this restaurant and we were not disappointed! We ordered three dinner platters and a noddle soup for 4 people and still had leftovers! I liked that they let us upgrade the white rice to fried rice for only a couple of dollars. 
The delivery took a little longer than we would have liked  considering we were only about a mile away and it was a Tuesday night, but the taste of the food more than made up for it!",1

"1131",5,"Great, attentive service, authentic and intimate ambiance, and portions were plentiful and tasty - would recommend for a change-of-pace date night or small-group dinner, especially on a weeknight!",1
"1132",4,"Excellent meal last night.  We started with the shrimp and basil pesto cream appetizer.  The sauce was even better than the shrimp.  They were out of mashed potatoes so we all had broccoli which was undercooked and hard to eat but otherwise the meal was wonderful as was the service for a busy Saturday (before mother's day) night.  

We had the stuffed catfish (father in law loved it), Pecan crusted trout (mother in law loved it), My husband created his own entree and didn't like it unfortunately.  He had blackened Redfish over dirty rice topped with crawfish etoufee.  The Etoufee was suuuuuuuuuuper bland.  It tasted like plain tomato sauce which was very surprising because everything else was so flavorful.  I felt bad for him as he didn't enjoy his dinner.  I had redfish topped with crawfish, shrimp in some sort of brandy cream sauce.  Delicious.  

We ended the night with the bread pudding, which even someone like me who doesn't like sweets, loved.  

I look forward to going back but no etoufee I guess.",1
"1133",5,"Where does the healthy eating fish and veggie girlfriend and her taco and french fry boyfriend go to dinner?  Boneheads.  My husband and I can eat the way we want to here even though we eat nothing alike.  Our common bond is the Peri Peri sauce which is also said to be an aphrodisiac.   (We may have conceived our son after eating here.)  The ""Extra Hot"" makes us feel adventurous in our pseudo-retired-rock star-new-parent lives.  The salmon and talapia are always grilled to perfection and sometimes I snatch some of my husbands fries, which are thin and crisp just like fries should be.  If you've got a taste for the hot and spicy and want something different than Mexican, then Bonehead's is your place.",1

"1135",5,"Absolutely amazing food.  Authentic and delicious.  Leave room for the dessert.  Well worth it!",1
"1136",4,"I've never had high-class Latin American food before -- I've been to local neighbourhood joints, some of which were kind of pricy, but nothing classy like Noche.  And it was ... noche good-ay.  Forgive me.

My friend opted for the Restaurant Week menu, which didn't really impress me, so I went off of the regular menu.  Part of me was thinking that Restaurant Week menus typically offer smaller serving sizes and lacklustre food, so perhaps the regular menu would fill me up better.  This wasn't the case -- good on Noche for serving smaller-than-expected portions all the time =]

I had high hopes for their plantain chips, which was Noche's equivalent of pre-appetizer bread.  While the chipotle aioli was delicious, the chips themselves were cooked until they were completely tasteless -- it wasn't sweet whatsoever, and what does anyone eat plantains for OTHER than the sweetness?!

My bud's appetizer was the smoked beef brisket and corn arepa.  The tomato salad on the side had this nice sharp quality, the brisket was well cooked, and the arepa itself was nicely made, if a little dense/unwieldy.  Still, pretty good!  I'd say the ones at Orinoco are still better, though.

Then, he got the hangar steak with potato salad -- the steak was a little bit burnt and not particularly special or evocative of Latin America, but the salad was pretty dece.  I got the Ropa Vieja, which looked like one of the house specialties.  It was OK.  Online, it says that the plantain is mashed.  THAT PLANTAIN IS NOT MASHED.  It's just another boring plantain chip.  WTF?  The garlic mofongo seemed like a mashed brown rice dish -- apparently there's supposed to be plantain in there too, but I couldn't tell.  Finally, the Cuban beef was indeed quite tasty; I just wish there was more of it.

The saving grace -- the only reason I'm giving Noche four stars -- were the desserts, which came straight off of the Restaurant Week menu.  My friend got the churros, which came with what seemed like a milk chocolate sauce (apparently it was dulce de leche).  They were pretty good, and came in a large portion size -- finally!  I, not wanting to repeat his choice, took the only other option on the menu, the Miami Key Lime Pie tartlette.  THIS WAS AWESOME.  I don't usually like citrus in desserts, but the lime was ... sublime.  It wasn't too strong -- it was just sweet and sour enough.  The tart pastry was also strong enough to hold up the lime in the centre, without being difficult to eat.

Overall, I'm not the biggest fan of Noche.  The plantain chips were a failure, portion sizes were small, and the flavours could have been improved.  But I would definitely come back for dessert!",1
"1137",5,"Make a reservation no matter what time of day or week you plan on eating here! Have eaten both dinner and brunch here and would highly recommend both. Beautiful atmosphere and the dining room is spacious. Even when the restaurant is full, it doesn't feel crowded. Both times, the wait staff has been attention, friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating with the food and drink. I have had many brunches, mainly in Chicago, yet even compared to those restaurants Wolfs ridge has been my favorite!",1
"1138",5,"So many great taco joints in Austin & Yummi just made my list. The spicy pork was awesome and the lemongrass chicken was excellent. Can't wait to take every friend who visits from out of town!",1
"1139",5,"The food was delicious and lots of it! My husband and I both ordered eggs,  bacon, hashbrowns, and French toast. Everything was cooked to order, the hashbrowns weren't greasy like some restaurants serve them and the French toast was thick, fluffy and flavorful. And Faith, our server, was a very sweet and attentive server. Definitely will be returning for brunch again soon!",1
"1140",4,"I stay here several times a year, as I work for a company about a mile away in Wakefield. It's a perfectly comfortable hotel, but where it really shines is its staff, especially in the restaurant and bar. Energetic, cheerful, great memory for my likes and dislikes -- it's a delight to be a guest at the Wakefield Sheraton.",1
"1141",5,"My boyfriend and I discovered this place while being stuck in rush hour traffic. We sat at the bar and enjoyed their wonderful happy hour: all drafts and wines by the glass were half off, and so were their bar bites! Our bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. Very cool spot!",1

If you haven't been, definitely check it out.",1
"1143",4,"Highly recommend! 

Union Square Donuts is one of my favorites. I firmly believe that the quality of a donut shop can be judged entirely on the traditional glazed donut. If you can't execute the basics flawlessly, why would I care about the fancy stuff?? The vanilla glaze donut is absurdly delicious. The dough has just the right amount of fluffy and the glaze is just right. The Belgian dark chocolate donut is also so good. For some reason it doesn't appeal to me in the display case, but then I'll get it and I really enjoy it. The raspberry filled is very good and recently I had the honey glaze and loved it. So many really great choices to pick from. I also recommend the nitro cold brew they have ""on tap"" - the best Saturday starts with a donut and coffee from here. 
The cons for union square donuts - I did not enjoy the sea salted bourbon caramel as much as the others and the maple bacon is a little overhyped. If you gotta try it, get it...but order something else with it. The pumpkin spice was good but not as pumpkiney (is that a word?) as I would have liked. What can I say, I'm #basic like that haha!  I don't recommend the apple cider donut - just wait to get one from the farms. 

Overall 4.5 stars!",1
"1144",5,"First time going in that I had time to look around. WOW, this place is clean, organized and amazing. This mom and pop owned shop has a great selection of fabrics, tools, buttons and patterns. Staff was very helpful with finding patterns for me, though there selection on men patterns were lacking. They have specials on certain fabrics and threads so very good for the wallet. 
Very well lite and organized!

Will go again defiantly.",1
"1145",4,"4-stars goes to the manager(?) working the front who got really excited when we walked in wearing SF Giants gear.

Kidding. B&G is a small but comfortable place that has some amazing oysters. That should be the very first thing you order. No excuses. We picked some random ones but they were all delicious. If you have any doubts, just ask the guy shucking them at the counter or take a look yourself (they're all labeled).

Service was great. My water was always refilled, we were always checked upon, and the food came out promptly.

I ordered the lobster BLT and it was so delicious. I don't even know how to pinpoint it. There was plenty of lobster meat and even the lettuce seemed crispy and fresh. It came with some slaw and a side of fries but after the sandwich I was already really full. My friend ordered the scallops and said they were good but I think the meal was a little small for his appetite (I believe there were only 3 scallops?).

Overall, we had a great experience here and would come back in a heartbeat. Definitely make a reservation though since the place is small.",1
"1146",5,"Doctor Le has been nothing but amazing. My family has been living in Newton for 15 years and have been bouncing around from one eye doctor to the next. However, now that we have found Doctor Le, we plan to never see another eye doctor again! Doctor Le puts so much effort and time into each and every one of her patients. She really takes the time to explain any questions and is very knowledgeable. Other than amazing eye care, she also provides great customer service. I bought glasses through the store she works at and had a few issues with them. Doctor Le was more than happy to replace the glasses without any fuss. Doctor Le also works on the weekends, so even people with busy schedules can fit in an appointment. If you are currently looking for a new eye doctor that will take the time to take care of all your eye needs, look no further!",1

I was immediately brought in seeking medical assistance for what I thought could've been an underlying problem or disease (WebMD makes everybody a doctor nowadays).Turns out I was just a tad dehydrated and needed to cut back on some unhealthy habits I've acquired since my recent transplant to Austin living. The doctor gave me all the information I could've needed with a very thorough explanation of every symptom I was experiencing. The very kind nurse had to take blood from me, and was the most painless and easy procedure. The staff as a whole are very effective, fast and efficient. During the end of my visit the receptionist had visited my room and went over all of my charges/ the cost of what my hospital visit would be for what services I decided to proceed with. (Very crucial for some people.) Overall the best hospital experience I have been through. Although the hospitality was magnificent, with a valuable staff, I hope I will not have to visit a hospital any time soon!",1

I researched a few places and found Nancy's through Yelp. She immediately made my daughter feel comfortable! There was a candy station and treasure chest she could choose from and she put little clips in her hair (which she loved). It was 15 for her cut. I couldn't believe it considering how long it took her to cut it being so thick. I will absolutely be coming here again and I am bringing my son to her today as well.",1

"1152",5,"What a great company.  My fridge stopped dispensing water and I could not find the exact reason so I called.  The lady that answered the phone was super helpful and sweet.  She gave me the window for my repair and I was ready.
On the day of the repair I set my alarm for the beginning of the window.  Who has ever heard of a repair person being on time?  Well Brandon was early!  Yeah I woke up to my bell ringing and my dog going crazy.  There were two missed calls on my phone.  Brandon apparently believes in being prompt.  I let him in and he set to work right away.  The repair was simple so he only charged me for the service call.  I was so happy with it all. 
This company will definitely be my first call if I need help again. Please call and see what customer service is!",1

The service is always great here. You can get a Bloody Mary (or any drink) while you wait, which is dangerous. They pack a punch and are also delicious. They have a great seasonal menu, so there are always new options to try.

The food is also consistently good, and I have tried the specials and the basic breakfasts every time I am in town. I've never been disappointed.

Parking is easy around here. Even in a big band van.",1

The people that work here are extremely knowledgeable and helpful without a hint of snobbishness.   This is definitely a higher-end bike shop, but they do still have some more reasonable options.  A great selection of very nice bikes, great employees, and a lot of know-how makes for a top notch bike shop.",1

"1156",4,"This place is a hdden gem! If you are in the market for affordable shoes, underwear, socks and athletic wear, you must make the pilgrimage to Zapatos! You can find great designer shoes here like Anne Klein, Dockers and Kenneth Cole at huge markdowns or cheap fun, stuff a la Payless that you can buy to wear for awhile until it falls apart. They also have a great selection of athletic wear, a lot of it from Hane's, marked down tremendously. I've gotten cute T-shirts here to work out in for $3 or $5. They also have tons of men's athletic pants and socks. Most everything is so cheap it lead a friend of mine to remark ""what, did this stuff fall off a truck?"". The staff is usually pretty helpful too and will offer you a shopping basket if your hands are getting full picking from up all those bargains. Also, they sometimes have a random selection of household items like toothpaste and shampoo for like $1 or $2. Part of the fun is not really knowing what they will have. But the glory of this place is in the cheap shoes! Viva Zapatos!",1
"1157",4,"Great restaurant. Food and wine was top notch, and perfect place to take my wife on her birthday.  I would have given five stars, but my wife's entree came out as one of the specials, not her order. But it was one of the items she was considering and had asked the waiter about so it was honest mistake.  He was awesome about it, and took care of us, and my wife ended up loving the dish they brought.  The  Beet tartare salad  as a starter was excellent, and my steak cooked perfectly.

I've been to the places in Asia, it's definitely comparable to their quality.  not only are they in the hot pot business; they offer items off the menu. You just need to pre-order and you can get whatever you want. They offer various seafood items and it's very fresh. I've brought all my friends here and the service is phenomenal.  All my friends have been back by themselves. They are great at hosting big groups too. Once you've been here,  you will want to come back.",1

I've been taking my dogs/getting supplies here for years. I walked in at 5 pm on a Tuesday and the receptionist wasn't sure they had a room available but after a few minutes, she cleaned one up, got us in, got him jacked up with all his shots and sent us on our merry way with great instructions for the next 5 days as well as a health ""passport"" so that I can easily keep track of his next shots.

They are warm and friendly and care about animals and that means a lot. If you just need the basics, this is the spot! I will be bringing the pup back for his neutering having had a good experience with them the last time I had a dog that required it. 

Shhhh.....don't tell the puppy!",1

For the sometimes fashion-challenged, take advantage of the store's personal shopping services. I stopped in on a Wednesday afternoon to try on a dress I'd been eyeing online.  One of the sales associates asked what I was shopping for, and I mentioned that I was leaving for vacation in a week. That was all it took to get up to three employees at a time bringing me item upon item and styling me for the better part of 2 hours.  (Thanks Julie and Dana!)

"1176",4,"Another pinterest-esque place to eat in Roslindale Village!

Seriously, is it just a Roslindale thing to have cute patios? It was humid-less summer afternoon so I took the opportunity to take my friends to Redd's for dinner and drinks out on their patio. To our surprise, the gate was locked and chairs were stacked on top of tables. Apparently, Redd's is only open on Sundays for brunch and closes after 3p. My friends were hangry and looked to me to rectify this situation and I did just that when I opened my handy dandy Yelp app to find this ""hot new restaurant."" 

753 South has an equally cute of a patio dining area as Redd's with dangling string lights and all. Food was fantastic too. I wasn't too hungry so I didn't get the brick chicken the other reviews mention. Instead I ordered the Cuban sandwich. The Cuban was slightly oily but the flavors were just right. Plus, I loved that there was plenty of pickles inside the sandwich and on the side! My friends got the burger and the walnut apple salad and both really liked their food. In fact, my eyes kept wandering to other tables because all the food looked so good! All in all, great food in a great space. I suggest making a trip out here before the weather gets too cold to sit in the patio.",1

When we found out that the club lounge was closed for renovations (or extended cleaning), my friends quickly rebooked at The Ritz just a round the corner on their club floor.  The Ritz refused to bend their pet policy so I was faced with a dilemma  of where to go.  The intercontinental had already bent their policy to accommodate his size.  He is ten years old and perfectly behaved, by the way. 
 
Rebecca (front desk manager) stepped in and exemplified what true ""five star service"" is all about.  Within a matter of minutes, she:
1) found a smaller room for my golden and i
2) hand delivered a gift basket of dog goodies and a little surprise for me, too
3) waived the pet fee
4) offered to pet sit while I went over to the Ritz to visit my friends the following morning

"1180",5,"Caution: my 5-star rating is for the quality of the cleaning only, not the booking or anything else. I read the Yelp reviews and understood that I shouldn't expect them to be perfectly on-time, so I just cleared my entire Saturday and booked it for that day. WOW! My apartment is SPOTLESS. The bathtubs alone were worth the $100 I paid for the Amazon deal plus tip. They really did a thorough job. I would hire them again in a second.

With that said, do be aware that the booking process is not perfect. I called and asked for a Saturday anytime, and Meire said that she would call me back on Tuesday with the time. I hadn't heard from her by Thursday, so I called and she said 3 or 4pm. On Friday night around 9, she called to ask if we could do 8am instead. I woke up at 7:30am on a Saturday morning to wait, and they didn't come until 9. Personally the quality was so good that I was not bothered by this at all, but I feel I should  mention it to people who are on tight schedules.

Lastly, note that she will ask you to list your priorities (e.g., dusting, bathrooms, kitchen floor, etc) because of the limited timeframe. We had a miscommunication in which I thought that I was listing everything in order with the understanding that she would get as far as she could, so I basicaly listed everything in my apartment. Whereas, she thought these were all considered equal high priorities, so in the end, she didn't get to the 3rd thing on my list. But when I explained what I expected they stayed longer and finished it. I really appreciated that.",1

I'm a pretty picky person and since moving from CA, I worried about finding a place that I love. Like anything in life, it can be extremely difficult to shop around for particular stores, salons, vets, etc so once I found this salon (thanks to all that yelped them :)) I was truly thankful and relieved.....this is one less chore on my list of things to do!",1

I wanted a second opinion, called On Target, Vinny was extremely professional and courteous. He came out and did a thorough  inspection of my home, and didn't see any sign of bed bugs. I was so grateful for his professionalism, and honesty. Although I wasn't in need of his service, I would recommend him!",1

Third: Spicy Rice Cakes is huge. It's actually good. 4 stars. I also got Ramen Noodle.. it was packaged I can tell. 1.5 stars... came with some diced zucchini and onions. Lol.. $9 for packaged and 2 veggies? 1 egg. Got 1 side... 

I'm a generous tipper. Why? Cause I'm a waiter. I know how it feels.

Inside you will gain alot of historical information from a more personal level of who JFK was as a man, son, father, brother, husband, and President. An added touch to this library and museum was the separate tribute to the First Lady, Jackie. Known for her fashion sense displayed are a few dresses she owned. The videos in the various rooms are informative and very educational. I am glad we were able to see this on our trip to Boston.",1

Classes are offered at multiple locations at a variety of times six days a week.  I can always find a day, time, and location that works for my schedule.  The trainers have gotten to know my fitness level and push and encourage me with each session.  I feel more in fit and I'm happy to have found Forte.",1

Growing up eating a lot of odd animal parts, I revel in the chance to get something unique when I go out. The one time I ate here I got the fried intestine with chili pappers. The lady who took my order did not understand what I was asking for because she never hears the words for the order in English (apparently it is not a favorite outside of people raised with it). Food was incredibly well done, nicely cooked without being overcooked, peppers weren't burned (which can be hard to do), not too greasy (although it is a slightly greasy meat anyway). They offer a wide variety of items like that, and I'm eager to go back and try more. Rice was good, as were my crab rangoons. Food was out for carry out in under ten minutes. Can't speak to the rest of it, but if the other food is just as good as that hard-to-cook cut, they'll be good for you, too. Always busy, so there has to be some consensus.",1

I tried St. Johns Coffee Roasters on a crazy Yelper camping trip a couple years ago (thanks Mary B!), and I swear, that was the best cup of coffee I've ever had.  It took me awhile to actually get out to the place where the best coffee comes from, but better late than never. 

I went traditional, had a caramel latte.  It was smooth and creamy, yet bold and amazing. After spending the morning bumming around St. Johns, I actually went back and got another cup of coffee.  Quick service, fair prices - but it's so popular that you can't always find a place to sit!",1

Very comfortable atmosphere and reasonably priced. Small dinning area but don't forget they have more dining in the back too. I definitely be back the best restaurant in town.",1

Around noon, the phone rings and its David asking me ""So what are you making for dessert?""  Now, I am known to make some pretty good desserts, but with the lack of time and ideas...I was stressing...I am definitely not Rachel Ray 30 min dessert chef!

Thank goodness for Alon's!  The place was packed with people like me, searching for the last min gift or dessert for tonight or tomorrow!  I wanted to have a variety of dessert instead of one huge cake or pie and this bakery definitely has the selection that I was looking for!  Sugar cookies, cheesecake, carrot cake, chocolate truffle cake...mmmmm!  I even picked up a cup of the black bean chili for some after workout protein...and it was quite good!

During the first two months after opening, it seemed impossible to get in without a reservation made weeks in advance. You go to the bar and it's packed, 5 deep. All great signs. 

I've sat in their dining area, their loungy area, and their bar - all have a great view of what's going on in the restaurant, who's coming in, and what's cooking in the kitchen. 

I think I've tried almost every small plate on their menu - everything comes out just right... but keep in mind that it does add up.

Never will Bobby try to upsell the customer or convince them to do unnecessary work. In fact on more than one occasion, he's suggested us not fixing a particular vehicle as it'd be a waste of money. 

Once I bought a Bronco that passed two other mechanic inspections, however Bobby & the guys saved my life. I took it to them to inspect prior to signing and they discovered leaking fuel lines & severely faulty spark plugs. I was literally driving around in a death trap that two other reputable shops had cleared! 

We trust them so much that even our dealer cars under warranty still go to Bobby for major work. Despite, having just moved to Colorado and being in the market for a used Jeep, I will be buying it in Texas so that Bobby can check it out first. You can't go wrong with this shop!",1

The slice of chocolate cake (basically a German chocolate cake with devil's food and a lot of rich filling) ranks up there with my favorite Chez Zee and Rebecca Rather desserts. Next time I'm likely to buy the whole cake and not just the slice ($4)! The veggie-filled corn empanada was fresh and flavorful with a soft, rich crust ($3.95) (do you detect a theme?). Prices are extremely reasonable. I look forward to trying other menu and bakery items.",1
"1211",4,"My friend passed by this place since it's near her house and wanted to try it. So glad we did! Small hidden cafe with delicious homemade dumplings and soup noodles! 

What we got:
- dan dan noodles 
- pork and chive dumplings (pan fried - they give you the option to either pan fry them or steam them) 
- chicken dumplings with Sichuan sauce 
- spicy beef noodle soup 
- crispy chicken noodle soup 
- deep fried buns 

What I thought: 
We started with the dumplings as appetizers and they didn't disappoint! They're made fresh in the restaurant. The chicken dumplings were soaked in this chili oil mixture that was spicy with a hint of sweetness and the chicken itself was tender and flavorful. The pork and chive dumplings were my favorite of the night. The pan fried bottom was a perfect level of crispness and the filling was juicy. Each dumpling dish came with about 5-6 of them. 

Next, we got the noodles. My friend had the crispy chicken noodle soup which was nice and clean tasting. The chicken wasn't seasoned or anything but deep fried to a crispy golden color and was delicious by itself. The soup was a bit on the salty side but super heartwarming. It came with some veggies and the noodles were a chewy consistency. The dan dan noodles (which is a mix of hot noodles with cold toppings) was a lovely mixture of cucumbers, pork/mustard greens, sauce and noodles. The spicy beef noodle soup was also very good with beef slices, veggies, soft boiled egg, and a spicy but tasty broth. 

Overall: The service was excellent with a very attentive host/waiter. The other customers there all praised their food when the waiter asked if everything was ok. The only thing is that the noodle dishes are on the smaller side as an entree and pricy for how much you get. However, getting an appetizer to share with an entree for each person is plenty of food to get full. This one flaw isn't enough to stop me from going back!",1

"1213",5,"How can you not give a good review to a place where you can get a burger with doughnuts for buns?  Seriously, though, this place is sinful.  Beer, doughnut-type desserts, and burgers with every bad thing you can imagine in them.  I'd go more often if I didn't think every visit was taking a year off my life.  Cool waiters, inventive drinks, and occasional events like open mic nights make for a fun atmosphere.",1
"1214",5,"Stopped in today to give El Super Pan a try, and I'll definitely be back. Located right in the middle of the Battery, the restaurant is a quick walk from the Galleria office complex over the pedestrian bridge. I had the lunch special which gets you a half sandwich, chips or salad, and a house made agua Fresca, all for $9.50. The salad was great, the dressing was not overpowering to the crisp buttery greens. I chose the Cubano Mixto sandwich which was also great. The special says you get a half sandwich but if this was a half I don't know that I'd be able to finish a full one. All the ingredients were perfectly balanced and the sandwich was toasted just enough to give a little crunch and warmth. My only suggestion would be to make the agua Fresca a touch less sweet, but they offer lemon/lime spa water in the restaurant so I was fine with that. 

All in all, for $9.50 I left a very satisfied customer and will definitely be suggesting ESP to my coworkers",1

When I entered it, I immediately noticed that this place has charming atmosphere, soft lighting and natural inferior. It has some good pieces of art that are made out of painted wood. It was fairly crowded when I arrived so I waited by the bar until I was called. The menu is large. There are lots of options for everybody. Prices are also very reasonable. I ordered sandwich and a plate of ""famous"" fries. After 5 minutes the waiter brought my order. The food was fantastic. I really liked everything. Now I understand that simple food can be delicious. Service was good; atmosphere was nice; it has cute location in town. What more could you ask for? A great place to go!",1

The burger was really good - adding the avo was the right choice - Glad I listened to our awesome waiter. I would have liked to come back for dinner one evening to have tried their drinks - but all in all - good food and great service. I'd be back!",1

The team was also extremely professional and incredibly well trained - the guy who helped me is an EMT.

Knowing that The Herbery is one of the few shops that sell Cedar Creek products, I knew what I was doing after dinner.  First time visiting this shop and won't be the last.  They have got a little bit of everything you could want and or need.  I got me the same thing I always get when I find Cedar Creek products, a fat Jack Herer joint.  And as always, I ask and get the sellers preferred. Tonights suggestion was NW Custom Chronic's Blue Magoo",1
"1232",4,"Although this place is called the Middle East Market and Deli, I really think that it should be ""Deli and Market"" because this place is a restaurant first. They serve great middle-eastern food, and since they serve it counter-style (like a fast food place) it's perfect for grabbing a lunch on the go!

The Good:

A Fast Lunch!: It's great that you can grab a boxed lunch super quick from this place and get on your way. there is a nice little eating area, but when you want good food in a hurry, this place is a great option!

Great groceries: If you've got someone with a flair for cooking Middle eastern food, this place has all the supplies they'll need, including spices, basmati, and hummus by the pound (my personal favorite!) 

The Bad:

Television Domination: Yes, they do have a big TV that shows Al-Jazeera, which generally broadcasts in Arabic. I don't really mind this (and I'm pretty sure they have English programs occasionally) But if you are looking to catch some television, I can see how you might be a bit miffed. 

The Middle East Market and Deli is a great place to grab a quick lunch, and if you need to grab some middle eastern groceries, you can't go wrong here!

Overall 8/9/10= Middle East Yummy!",1
"1233",4,"Another one of my favorite coffee shops in Austin. It is the one I go to the least simply because it is much farther compared to the others. However, what attracts me is Summermoon's magical ""moon milk."" The moon milk is beyond amazing. It tastes like sweetened caramel with milk, which happen to be two of my favorite ingredients in a drink. Depending on the season, I normally get the Wintermoon (cold drink) or Summermoon Latte (hot drink). The ""moon"" drinks can be a little too sweet if you have a sensitive sweet tooth. However, there is always the Half Moon Latte, which is simply half as sweet as the Summermoon Latte.

The drinks are pretty pricy here, but I think they are completely worth it because of the ""moon milk."" It is THAT good. If you have not tried it, you must. NOW. Today. Tomorrow.

Summermoon also recently rearranged the furniture, which has made studying here exponentially easier.",1

I would recommend going with the ""sampler"" which comes with a salad, and then an array of different dishes to try.  They also have a vegetarian sampler if you're so inclined.

Service was friendly, efficient and thorough. I wouldn't recommend anyone else.",1

"1238",5,"We had eaten here once a long while back before the remodel. We returned last night and it was outstanding. We were seated promptly around 6 on a Saturday. Our server was terrific. In fact, he provided some of the best service we have received at an Austin restaurant in a long time. We started with the corn taro fritters, which are addictive. I didn't think the two of us could polish off the basket, but we did. I just about lost my husband for 20-30 minutes while he attempted to reach the bottom of his bowl of Kao Soi (chicken leg quarter in a yellow coconut curry sauce). I enjoyed the Tom Yum Fried Rice (a shrimp dish). My dish contained about six or seven shrimps. Both were two chili pepper listings and the spice level was not all that hot (usually a single chili is where I max out), but they were both extremely flavorful. The new decor is very nice - modern but comfortable - and the noise level was such that one could carry on a conversation. We're going to try to save room for dessert next time.",1
"1239",4,"I accidently went here last week when I was trying to go to a tire shop a little further down the highway. I am happy I did.

"1243",4,"Even without booze, this place is great.  We stopped in just to browse.  We  walked out with two cheese, some eggplant spread, and a few other items.  The men working there are serious about their food and beer.  They gave us a lot of good info and tempted us with samples of cheeses and dips that we simply HAD to buy.  They asked us about our meal at Publick House.  When we told them what we ordered, they talked about pairings and about the food and they just seemed so intense about it--but in a good way.

We'll be back.",1

We take all our friends out to Blue Fin for dinner; I eat lunch there 2x a month at the counter next to this lovely Japanese woman who probably eats lunch there every day.

"1245",4,"Lovely hidden Austin gem. Came to the Butterfly Bar for the first time for a trivia night and it definitely fills up quickly--even on a weeknight. It was a bit disappointing that they didn't have any beers on tap, but as other reviewers have mentioned, they're touted more as a cocktail bar. I ended up grabbing a local can of Saison and took a seat outside in their back patio. Even on a hot summer day, the patio was pleasant and had a very relaxed sensibility. The bartenders are friendly and their drink prices are reasonable for a downtown Austin bar. Plus--they have a pretty ample parking lot, which is always something I appreciate.",1

"1251",5,"Excellent service from valet to hostess to wait staff - friendly and professional. Today's lunch special was the black bass and it was fantastic - great flavor. Atmosphere is upscale yet relaxed and welcoming. This will definitely be a part of my rotation for both business and non business dining. Highly recommended!",1
"1252",4,"I have read many of the reviews of 888 and I have noticed a lot of them mention the pho.  I have yet to have had this pho, but let me tell you a little bit about my experience.  My friend Mark and I eat out nearly everyday.  We both piddle around the house during the day (jobs) and we decided to branch out from our normal ten lunch spots an go the opposite direction on Oltorf.  

Upon entrance, we were greeted by a very nice lady, shown our seats and immediately given glasses of water.    They handed us menus and asked us if we were interested in the buffet.

We were interested in the buffet.  I believe that variety is the spice of life and I liked that during our three minutes of sitting down, I had seen two different cooks come out and restock the buffet with delectable looking curries, breads, and many other vegetarian and meat dishes.

All of the food was good.  Nothing stood out as excellent.  Nothing stood out as being poor.  Just a good lunch for around 7 bucks.  It was pretty crowded, but the noise level was alright and the people in there were being taken care of and it had a pretty good feel to it.

We will be back and I might finally try the strange looking tofu dish i saw last time.

"1254",5,"Shrimp toast (I have seen it mentioned in every other review as well), fantastic cocktails, and great dark ambience. The food was amazing, and fairly priced.

Better than any cocktail venue I have been to in my hometown of Minneapolis. I may just have to go back for seconds before returning home...",1
"1255",4,"Great sports bar if you don't spending the $$. You can easily watch sport and lose track of how much youre spending. The burgers are great. The fries are amazing. The wings are fantastic. I really like this place.",1
"1256",5,"I don't know if this place needs another glowing review but it's getting one either way. The chi che is some of the best fish curry I've ever had. They used striped pangasius, which is similar to catfish- deep fry it and smother it with red curry. It's amazing. The Tom Kha is baller. Fried rice, noodle dishes, curry- you can't go wrong. Yes it's packed- that's because it's delicious.",1
"1257",4,"It's great to walk in no appointment and get a pedi. Service was quality and fast! I'll be back again. I thought the price was reasonable as well.",1
"1258",4,"I had a friend out of town over memorial day weekend and she picked this place for our first dinner. It was great! Expensive nonetheless, but melt in your mouth amazing. The only part I didn't find all too great was the rolls and sushi, they were not bad, pretty good but not melt in your mouth amazing like their small grill and cold plates. We had the following: 
-kiyoshi for drinks. Very delicate and subtle sweet champagne cocktail with lemon, one of my favorite things that evening!
-maguro sashimi and goat cheese: Excellent
-Suzuki yaki: My absolute favorite, I wish we ordered more of these!
-Shime saba: ok
-gyutan toro: ok
-hamachi: ok
-p-38 roll: pretty good
-crunchy tuna: pretty good
we also had Japanese sweet potato fries that were amazing and for dessert fried milk, best dessert I had in a while!

Also, A+ for presentation, I wished we would have taken pictures. I'd love to go back but definitely happy hour.",1
"1259",4,"One of the best kept secrets in Orlando, in our opinion. We make dinner here a vacation tradition. Consistently good food, tasty and savory not greasy. Beautiful presentation. Service may be a little slow but always polite. Live music (harp and guitar) round out the evening nicely.",1
"1260",5,"Our family has enjoyed many meals here & take out. Food never disappoints. They make sushi fresh to order. Delicious homemade soups. I love the pad thi & kiddo loves the oragange chicken. Husband always gets the sesemi chicken. Service is great. Very clean. Owners are always there & happy. A great restaurant.",1
"1261",5,"Besides the 40 minute wait to get in, tasty's is definitely a place to hit for Indian food. In fact, this is the only place you should be eating Indian food in Surrey! I'm East Indian and refuse to eat Indian cuisine outside of home. However, when I do crave a specific dish that can't be made at home this is the only place I go. They cater to vegetarians as well as meat eaters. Food may seem pricey but it's worth the price. 

We went on Christmas Eve because they were one of the only places open. The service was great and they accommodate to large parties (just make sure to make reservations days in advance). The waits are usually long so don't go there starving, especially in the evenings.

The food gets a solid 10/10! Must-tries are the paneer naan (cheese stuffed fluffy bread), garlic naan, vegetable manchurian and the warm gulaab jamins (dessert). MY GOSH!! The gulaab jamins are the best I've had in my life.. do not leave without ordering these or you willl regret it.",1

"1265",4,"Pretty good. A tad pricey, but the spicy basil duck tofu was great! The peanut sauce (comes separately from dish) for the tofu garden was lackluster, but sufficient. I would come again when craving Thai in JP.

The rice is a separate from the entree. White rice is 1.50 and Brown is $2.00, so something to consider.",1
"1266",5,"The room was a ton of fun!  Our host was in character, and the puzzles were creative and related to the theme.  It is dim lighting, but it adds to the overall ambience. Also, the room was more intricate than we first realized. If you are extra observant you will have a great time.  We got into a flow and powered through quickly, then realized there was more to the game than we first realized.  Definitely one of my favorite escape rooms. Nice job, Escapism!",1

"1269",5,"The North End is the best neighborhood in Boston. Were I the sort of person who wanted to sacrifice spacious apartment living and proximity to a pond, I would gladly live in a cramped closet-sized apartment here, if just to walk out my door and sigh wistfully at the architecture. The North End makes me sigh frequently in a positive way, and I am not even a romantic person. Granted, it is frequently overrun with tourists, but this part of Boston has character that no other neighborhood comes close to. It also houses the city's best 24-hour option, a bakery where you can get fresh bread and delicious cannolis at any hour of the day. You will never be able to find parking in the North End, and this is perfect, because it is a neighborhood best experienced on foot. There is no better way to spend an afternoon or evening than wandering around Haymarket and then roaming the streets of the North End. It makes Boston feel like a legitimate Big Old City. I adore it.",1
"1270",4,"This is a great neighborhood liquor store. The staff is always friendly (they'll tell you where to buy limes when they're out for example) and the store often has wine tastings. Good selection of wines. Great hours - open 7 days a week.",1
"1271",4,"I been an ongoing fan of Tortilleria La Mexicana on Oakridge for quite some time now. Anytime there is a craving for authentic Mexican food I fly over here. At food being under $10 an entree they serve a variety of tacos, enchiladas, flautas, and sopes/huaraches. My favorite day to go is on a Sunday because the mariachi band will perform and they usually have a soccer game playing on all the tvs. 

From all the items on the menu the best choices are the tacos, huaraches, and horchatas. The huaraches is a popular mexican dish that consist of a fried masa base with your choice of meat/ sausage/ chicken along with lettuce, tomatoes, pice, onions, cheese, and sour cream. Tortilleria uses delicious white Mexican cheese on the huaraches so every bite is memorable. The tacos have a soft corn tortilla base which I absolutely love to order with shredded chicken inside. They also use cilantro, diced tomatoes, and onions inside the taco so you get a flavorable but fresh bite. I tried their enchiladas but wasn't too found of them since the refried beans seemed stale so I always stick with other menu options.

Tortilleria also has a stall of Mexican ice creams and icy cool ""agua frescas"" in many different flavors. Make sure to try the coconut and horchata flavor, you will be hooked! One time I was lucky enough to run into their frozen chocolate bananas with sprinkles. Sadly they only make them very rarely and they sell out quick. Shortly stated this is a must stop for those in need of authentic Mexican food!",1
"1272",5,"This place is great.  I've been here a handful of times and I have never had a bad meal.  It's the closest thing you can get to North End quality Italian without having to go there.  Prices can be a little bit on the expensive side but usually it's worth it because you can get 2 meals out of the portion size.  Overall great place to eat if you want good italian and don't want to deal with the craziness of the North End!",1
"1273",4,"Buttermilk old fashioned... I go out of my way to get this donut",1
"1274",4,"I wrote a review back in Dec 2014. The food is still great! I try to go at least once a month. They have a new young women at the front desk now, she speaks better english. I know people have written about some of the staff. When I first went there I did not think them rude, but not very friendly. Again, I think this has to do more with cultural issues than anything else. Maybe that's why my last three visits I have not seen the gentlemen that most other Yelper have issues with. Those hibachi noodles are like a drug!!! So tasty. I have also gotten some sushi and it's really good. It's also really good the next day. I normally have to toss out sushi from other places as it does not keep well. Usually it's the rice. However, it's leftovers with Tokyo rolls. The inside never really seem to change much, but I don't care as long as they keep the noodles the same.",1
"1275",5,"This place redeemed my faith in Macaroni Grill's. There's one not too far from my house in Pembroke Pines and it's horrible-- both service and food. Knowing that, you can understand my apprehension with coming here as the restaurant we intended on dining at had an hour wait. We were seated after waiting about five minutes by someone who I believe was one of the managers. She was super friendly, asking us where we were from and what brought us to Orlando. Our server was equally nice and was attentive throughout our dining experience. 

The table ordered two lasagna bolognese's and one chicken under the table. The lasagna was excellent. Perfectly cooked, served hot, and the cheese wasn't overwhelming (disclaimer: my life obsession is cheese and my opinion is that there can ever be too much of it). The chicken under the table came with brocollini, which according to my mom, was delicious. She said the potatoes were great as well. Overall, this place was excellent. The service was great, the delivery of food was speedy, and the food itself was worth the trip. Now, if only the Macaroni Grill in Pembroke Pines were like this....",1
"1276",5,"I was in Boulder for about 3 weeks and ended up going to the noon vinyasa class almost every single day. I had an extended (almost a full year!) break from yoga before I started here and not only did it feel amazing to reconnect with the practice, but in the 3 short weeks I went, I was able to catch up and progress past where I was before.

I took classes with Mary, Erin, Melissa and once with Billy. Though they each have their own style, I highly recommend them all. They were all warm, personable and helpful - they remember your name, your story, your particular needs. 

The classes were a perfect mix of spirituality and challenging physical work. The teachers were fantastic at guiding the class and making adjustments. Every now and then, they slip in little life lessons to keep in mind ""both on and off the mat."" 

This studio introduced me to Ashtanga yoga, which has given my practice a wonderful new direction. So sad that I don't live here any more but if any of them are ever on tour, I would go out of my way to get to their class.",1
"1277",5,"Their donut holes are AMAZING. I needed some at the last minute one evening but they were sold out. The owner made some on the spot for me! This was awesome service that is hard to come by these days. Now they are the only donut shop that I buy from.",1
"1278",5,"I got a haircut at Trix because my hairstylist, Helen, has moved to this location. This location is clean and just as convenient as the previous location. Of course, Helen never failed to impress me with her hair cutting techniques. I have long hair and I didn't have to bring in any pictures (but they do help if you want something more specific). Helen knew what I wanted and layered my hair to frame my face. I am especially particular about my bangs, and had to fix it myself after getting haircuts by other hairstylist. With Helen, I am content enough not having to fix it further, not to mention that she is also very pleasant to talk to. 

The other side of the room is for mani/pedi, which I am tempted to try as well the next time I have a haircut because all the equipment seems fairly new and clean.",1
"1279",4,"This is a great place for a date.  But it is pricey.  If you're the type that eats a lot, then this is not the place for you.  The portions are small, but I kinda liked that.  I didn't waste a single bite!  I went with my boyfriend and we had a dozen oysters before our entree and we were just full enough to be comfortable.  the seafood stew was sooooo good.  I kept asking for bread to dip into the stew.  Their wines, pricey, but very good selection!  desserts needed some help.  only 3 choices so we skipped it...but i did think about ordering more oysters!  Go on a Sunday or Monday and they have a special menu for lobsters and oysters.  parking sucks in that area, but they have valet for $16.  I would wait until it gets warmer and park a little further to enjoy the stroll through the south end and avoid the valet fees.
So, looking back at last night, I'd say it was one of the better meals I've had this year!  Go check it out for yourself!",1
"1280",5,"This is the best place I have found. I get my nails done here, and their pedicures are out of this world, thorough, relaxing, just the very best. Hong and all of the employees go above and beyond. Thank you!",1

"1286",5,"The chicken is just simply the best that I ever tasted. No hot sauce needed honestly it is packed with so much flavor and the meals come with the beans and cold slaw which is really the best and I'm not even huge on cold slaw I have up graded from ordering a two piece to ordering a half chicken whenever I'm in town.",1

I know. Mall rolls-but man are they tasty!",1
"1289",5,"Wow surprised to read the negative reviews. I have been going to Joe's Pizza for a couple years. Once I found Joe's it is my go to place for Chicken Caesar Salad and pizza.

"1290",5,"ANOTHER AWESOME dinner at Bar Taco.  We came to celebrate my nephews 21st birthday.  Because the ""big"" celebration is this weekend he just wanted something lite with really good flavor. This was his 1st visit here and he LOVED it.  We had guacamole, salsa verde, tacos (Baja pork belly, curry shrimp, wild boar, mahi mahi and ribeye), grilled corn and the cauliflower rice bowl.  EVERYTHING was amazingly flavorful and good.  so much flavor.  The service and atmosphere is always amazing and Lee (General Manager), your one of the greatest.  Welcome to Atlanta!  We (Atlanta) needs more in the industry like you.",1

What took our dinner experience to a whole new level was our server.  Jackson is THE BOMB! He provided us exemplary customer service.  If you go to J Gilbert's, I highly recommend you ask for him.  Pleasant personality and attitude, and it was very clear that he is customer service driven. I feel that way about the restaurant in general too.  If you use a coupon/certificate at the restaurant or want to switch out side dishes, it's not a problem at this J Gilbert's vs. other establishments that spend time telling you what they can't do for you.  We finished dinner and left talking about Jackson in the car.  Oh, and our dinner was fantastic as usual.  Thanks!!",1

The staff are friendly. Great location!",1
"1295",5,"I went to this place during the grand opening and the location is great so I have gone back.

The grand opening really was just that they gave away free beer, regular fountain drinks and 2 tacos per customer.  That was spectacular and such a fun night!

I always love love the fried avocado taco.  That is seriously my favorite but my friends adore the baja shrimp taco and the Dirty Sanchez.  I even tried their take on carnitas, the pulled pork was very nice, I just love the avocado the best!  

This is such a great Torchy's and the woofies are allowed on deck, I mean, patio area!  We love that!",1

"1299",4,"Heard great things about this place, and I will agree with all of them. Went there for breakfast for the first time this past weekend. Classic, old-school, greasy-spoon...whatever you call it, this is the place to go if you are looking for a hearty breakfast. This is the type of place where you walk out smelling like grease. Oh yeah!!! Good food, good portions at reasonable prices. Highly recommend for a weekend breakfast. Go early since seating is very limited. Also, if you drive there, park on Hancock. They have only 3 or 4 spots in front of the diner. They also have takeout!",1
"1300",5,"If you ever have a chance to visit Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park. Yak & Yeti Restaurant is another good choice for you when you are looking for a good food and good service. 

Yak & Yeti is a fine table-service dining which will serve you during lunch and dinner.
And this restaurant is base of Mt. Everest in the small town of Anandapur. This place serves Asian fusion ( Combines flavor from China, India and Nepal) 

My fianc├®, our godson and I had a wonderful meal there at Yak and Yeti Restaurant. 
We started with Wok-Fried green beans, House Salad, and Thai Chili Chicken Wings as our appetizers. These dishes were so wonderful. Then we had Combo (shrimp and Chicken) Lo Mein , saut├®ed egg noodles, carrots, cabbage, green onions and bean sprouts for our main dish. I would say, we really loved the food and this place. We got a really nice service as well.   

Too bad, this place is too far a way from me to visit often. Otherwise I will be a big fan.

"1305",4,"Very good Japanese. We ordered the omakase menu and the chef made a beautiful multi course meal for us. Delicious! Raw courses were better than the cooked dishes however. 

Very flavorful sashimi and sushi. Waygu beef sushi with onsen egg was great. 

Best to go with people you have tons to chat about. Maybe eat something before you arrive too.  Restaurant is still ironing out kinks in kitchen speed. Dishes were a tad slow in coming out. But they were beautiful when they arrived. Helpful to your overall mood if you aren't famished.

They had a couple vegetarian ramen options which I really appreciated knowing I was not stuck to one item on the menu. I ordered the classic ramen and the broth was so flavorful and perfect amount of spicy with what I asked for. We did have to wait in line for about 30-45 minutes which was completely worth it. Keep in mind you have to stand in line, no reservation or put your name on the list.",1
"1309",5,"Been here at the Seaport for about 7 days, with only three more to go.  It was a mix of pleasure and business (professional conference).
  First of all, we found the service exceptional.  It reminds me very much of the Monterey Plaza Hotel in Monterey, CA, with regards to staffing, friendliness, and attention to detail.
  We made fast friends with Robert, one of the managers, and Allanah, the desk staff who checked us in.  Each day I saw Robert, I was greeted with a ""Good Morning"", a smile, and a firm handshake.
  Though I never got a chance to take advantage of it, the hotel features free bicycles and helmets on a ""first come, first serve"" basis.  The health club on the Plaza level is exceptional.  It is a commercial spa located on the property that you have free access to.  Great, new equipment and a lot of it.  Fresh coffee, citrus infused water, and a bowl of fruit await you at the completion of your workout.
  One of the things that impressed me is the hotel has free WiFi around the property ... and it is everywhere!  I didn't find it spotty at all, in fact the WiFi router was next to my cardio machine in the spa!  I also found the speeds of the WiFi were exceptional.
  The Seaport is close to many wonderful restaurants, and a free ""Boston Coach"" shuttle runs every 15 minutes or so downtown and drops you off at the corner of Waters and Devonshire - close to the Faneuil Market area and other ""must see"" spots.  The hotel is also right across the street from the Silver Line bus that links to Logan Airport and the rest of the greater Boston transit system.  The hotel also offers a by-reservation free town car to take you out to dinner that runs until 6:45P.  It will get you there, but you might have to walk or take a cab back.
  It is about a 0.5 mile walk from the hotel to the Boston Tea Party Museum, the Children's Museum, and Flour bakery!  There is a 7-11 and Dunkin' Donuts across the street, and J. Pace market is a couple blocks to the south which features deli sandwiches as well as hot food and other grocery supplies.  I was able to pick up a few containers of greek yogurt and fresh fruit to get me through the week.
  The conference facilities have been exceptional. The student ""tables"" are more like desks; food service has been stellar; and the staff accommodating.   There are a couple of small parks a block or so away to get away from the hustle and bustle a bit; and the hotel features a small green area just outside the meeting room area on the Plaza level with benches, grass, and shade trees.
  While the hotel is a tip-inclusive property, you couldn't help but slip the staff a few bucks for the wonderful job they did.
  I had a mini-suite room that was more than spacious, decorated with taste, and very comfortable.  Big showers and tubs, top rated shampoos, soaps, and lotions, a small refrig, large desk, and a terribly comfortable bed.  Even got to use their ""pillow"" library to find one that suited my wife.
  Highly recommend the property if you are coming to Boston.  It is a wonderful place!",1
"1310",5,"Had the BEST baby shower ever there!!!!  Delicious hot food, stunning room with roaring fireplace, and the most attentive function coordinator ever! Thank you Wendy Feener. You were exceptional. I definitely highly recommend this phenomenal restaurant for their unique menu and out of the ordinary service!....

Highly recommended Tuscan Kitchen, Burlington!
Ty again Wendy,  you  MADE THE DAY!",1
"1311",5,"First time trying ethiopian food, so take this review with a grain of salt Judgey McJudge Judge. 

First of all, the vibe at Desta was super cute and comforting. Right out front is an open patio setup with a bar and ample seating. The weather was a bit brisk for Atlanta so it was closed for the moment but I could definitely see it being a primo spot when the temp spikes.

Was on my Han Solo and took a table for one. First mistake--I didn't realize how much of Desta's food and culture is about sharing and large platters. I never felt awkward in terms of service, but it definitely was a lot of food for just one. However, a complainer I am not. I took my multi-dish deliciousness in stride. To start I had the Sambusa's. They were crispy and addicting from the first bite. I got mine filled with minced beef and plunged bravely into the spicy dip. I could've eaten about a million of those, but alas, the main dishes called.

I did the lamb tibs with tomato fit fit and injera and man oh man, this stuff was Ah-mazing. Spicy, sweet, umami salty greatness. Plus a plethora of fresh urbs and the cool balance of the tomato fitfit was the perfect first step into ethiopian food for me. Definitely hooked. The only thing I probably wouldn't try again was the miser--lentils and I are sitll in the first date stages and I wasn't wowed. Although, I'm sure that has everything to do with my personal preference and not a reflection of the restaurant. 

All in all, TAKE ME BACK. after all the southern classics of brown and yellow fried fare, Desta was a very welcome tasty salvation.",1

"1315",4,"Food is good and service was quick.  Although some items are more expensive, the traditional noodles are affordable and the spices (if you ask for them) give a great flavor that complements the food nicely. Nice touch: You get tea with your order!",1
"1316",5,"I attended a wedding there on 4/19/14 and the staff did a wonderful job. The wedding party suites were amazing, Huge area's with pool tables, poker tables multiple big screens tv's and dressing rooms. Great way to pass a few hours before the event. The outdoor area was wonderfully cared for and the huge waterfall was a beautiful backdrop for the outdoor wedding. Their was always plenty of staff at the bars to there was never a line and the food was amazing.  Great facility for a wedding!!  The one I attended was 150 people.  Not sure about the pool and golf facilities as I belong to another club and didn't was only at Scioto Reserve for a wedding.",1

The main study area is bright and open.  Seating is easy to come by, and outlets are plentiful.  I've never had a problem with the Wi-fi running quickly.  

My only gripe about this library is the staff themselves (and the parking.  Oh, the parking.  Why is it so hard to get a spot in the middle of the day in suburbia?)  The librarians clearly don't understand the definition of ""indoor voice"" and shout to each other across rooms, or talk to patrons as if they're at a Patriots game.  Whisper please.  It's a library, people.",1

The homemade gnoccis and chicken, lamb, and shrimp mixed grill  were incredibly delicious.  We have been there a few times and each visit  is worth the trip.  You feel at home in their restaurant.  It's our favorite new spot in Medford. Thank you for treating us so special. Lantanas does everything right!!! Try it soon.",1
"1324",5,"This is by far my favorite Chinese Food joint.  Been going to this restaurant for 15 years.  They recently remodeled and have new tables, tvs, etc.  From the outside it doesn't look so great because they have these two huge doors in the front that are not very inviting, but once inside its pretty nice.  I love the food, especially the shrimp fried rice (no onions please), it's reasonably priced and the service is always top notch.  I LOVE IT!",1
"1325",4,"Oh you know, what needs to be said about the drafthouse? It's an institution. It has changed the way I attend the movies, and I am very thankful for that and am an avid Drafthouse fan. 
The new South Lamar location is everything I'd hoped it be, that is, there is a free parking garage (oh yes, I remember spending 20 min looking for parking at the old Lamar location) -- hopefully this stays once the entire shopping complex is done and it isn't just a ploy to win me over temporarily. 
Everything inside seems to be the same as before, maybe a little new-ish, and I am very ok with that. 
My only gripe is the service, like many drafthouses, it's really freakin' slow. I've been twice since this place has re-opened, and last night the movie ended and we still hadn't gotten our checks. Talk about awkward. 
If the servers could hustle more, and whisper less (seriously) -- this place would be five stars in my book.",1

Guys, my girl was super stoked to be the one getting the flight lesson while I was in the back seat chillin.  Lesson: take your girl on a flight and you will get major brownie points.  This is tons of fun and not expensive like I thought it would be.  George is great and we will be back!",1
"1331",4,"Chanterelle's describes itself as ""soul food with a french cuisine spin""
Ok so I lived in Atlanta..nearly 5 mins from this place and i NEVER knew it existed. However I had ""heard"" that they had some good food. Now if 
your going to judge it on looks they get a ""0"" because it looks horrible from the outside....but once you go in.....you smell the wonderful aromas of all the food. 

The food is served cafeteria style...They have tons of choices...just to make ur mouth water i'll tell you a few....rosemary chicken, barbecue chicken, flounder, and vegetables.....they have potatoes, rice pilaf, squash, zucchini, cabbage, but everything is seasoned perfectly and very tasty. Oh and they have this wonderful, fresh, homemade lemonade....u HAVE to get that! Its a bit on the pricey side. I bought the rosemary chicken with potatoes, cornbread and a lemonade for 9.50 whew!

Although they have this one cashier...she is just not friendly...i mean she has not smiled once and i've been going there for a year. I really wish they would replace her with someone a lil happier!

Definitely if your in the area you should give this place a try. They have parking on the street and some reserved parking in the Krispy Kreme parking lot.",1
"1332",5,"Very good experience both times I have been here. 

Most importantly manicure and pedicure were perfection! 

2 days later I did get a chip on nail and when I called they told me to come in and happily repaired nail for free. I did leave tip for the aesthetician's time.

Clean and friendly. Make an appointment ....they are busy!",1
"1333",5,"Parking is easy at this location and they validate.  Who doesn't like to be validated?  It's what we live for, right?  
Let's get to it.  The atmosphere here is great, the decor is fine right.  Just the right amount of mid century design without being cliche, an homage to all that was great from coffee shops of that era.  

Next is service.  The hostesses were friendly and acknowledged us right away.  We were seated in a nice cozy booth and given menus.  

The best part of our dining experience was Shanaya!  She greeted us with one of the friendliest smiles I have experienced in a long time.  She was genuinely friendly and a delight.  She brought our coffee and water and asked us if we had been in before.  I said no.  She broke the menu down for us and explained some of the items.  From greeting to bringing us the check she was present and engaging.  To that point I must say that all the staff were really friendly and seemed to enjoy their job but we were being waited on by Shay and i want to be sure she is singled out!

I will definitely be returning!",1
"1334",4,"This ice cream place is all it is hyped to be it was soo good!!! but so over priced.

1 scoop with cone $7
2 scoops $9

A pint is $11 

I bought 3 pints 1) London Fog  seriously good make sure you get it basically what their known for

2) sweet cream

3) Apple pie this one i believe is a season flavour only so i definitely recommend it has pieces of apple pie and cinnamon which is seriously good

Even though it is a bit over priced i honestly would come back but i dont recommend you get any of the regular flavours like cookies and creme or chocolate because of your getting such a expensive ice cream try something different!!

Good: 
they have a express line up to buy pints which is a bit quicker if you want to get in and get out.

If you purchase a pint you can return the glass jar and get $1 back

They have metal spoons for you to try which flavour you want before you buy if your indecisive like me

they accept credit/debit/cash and no taxes!!! 

Bad:

finding parking somewhere on the street

lineups, be prepared to wait!!!",1
"1335",5,"We got in here by chance, and it was a truly magnificent experience. We were doubtful of the 'Asian fusion', but this, now looking back, silly thought was instantly banished from us. Everything was so flavorful and delicious, the fusion enhanced every aspect of what was already well-made, fresh ingredients. The Mapo Tofu is by far our favorite, with a slight hint of spice, the tofu exploded with flavor upon being chewed, it's aftertaste lingering in your mouth, making you crave for more.",1
"1336",4,"Came here last night after discovering that no respectable Mexican joint was taking credit cards. So I had my friend drive me all the way to the Alphabet District for some reverse happy hour.

Love the setting in this restaurant. Cute people work here, equally cute people go here, and it's just laid back overall. They have a great reverse happy hour from 10 pm-1 am with $4-$5 plates. We got the chips and guac, beer battered shrimp tacos, and the blackened fish tacos.

The tacos were huge and delicious and perfect after a complete day of drinking. Definitely coming back to try the margaritas!",1
"1337",4,"It may be difficult to justify spending $6.50 on just two cupcakes, but a purchase from Sweet is much more than a means of satifying a persistant sugar tooth.

"1338",5,"Virgin America located at Terminal B at Logan is definitely a needed addition to Logan Airport. They only have a few gates but the big plus is the security line/gate only services Virgin so the security line is smaller. 

The waiting area is typical Logan but only has one food vendor (Cosi). 
Gate attendants have much more friendlier and modern look. 

The planes are new and have three classes of service (First, Main Cabin Select and Main Cabin) Main Cabin Select has more leg room with free food and drinks - seats located in the Emergency Exit rows and first row after First Class Cabin, Main Cabin you pay for food and drinks with less leg room. First Class seats are larger and recline and more leg room with free food, drinks and movies. 

All seating has it's own TV screen with touch menu to order movies, food and drinks. Wifi is provided by Gogo Inflight Internet. (if you plan on using Internet; go to Gogo website for discounts) 

Food and wine selection is better than other US carriers. Service is much friendlier. The cabin lighting is much better and more relaxing. 

Design and style of Virgin America is much better than any other US Carrier.

It is great for the American Consumer to have a new option over American Airlines",1
"1339",4,"So im not one to ever write reviews, but in this case i felt like i needed to. I was a little nervous walking in, I am african american with natural hair and I didnt know how well my hair was going to be treated since not that many mainstream places i go dont know how to do black hair. I was pleasantly surprised to have such a great time. Although the seating area is limited, and i did wait a little past my appointment, it was all made up by the treatment that i received. I was literally their last client of the day, and they treated me as if I was their first! I really enjoyed the ladies there, and they were so helpful in explaining maintenance for my natural hair. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and even though i was the last person in there, they didnt rush! I mean it is my first time there and i saw the other comments about inconsistency, but i guess i will just see when i go again this weekend! but overall, i enjoyed myself. 

I would just like to say about the service, my hair washer, Carmen, was amazing, she had no problem really getting up in my scalp and my hair, she was gentle yet firm. Also my stylist, Edith, was really good and nice. I had just seen her do another clients hair and i thought she was tired. I know I would be, but she tended to me just as much as she did the other girl, and that is what made all the difference! I cant wait to go back =]",1
"1340",5,"A shining light in the darkness that is corporate radio.

My life wouldn't be as complete without Radio 1190.  Seriously.  Music is one of my biggest passions, and Radio 1190 consistently gives me soul food for my ears.  Where else can you hear Cut Copy, Hank Williams Sr., Atmosphere and Sharon Jones, all in one set?  They truly cover the entire spectrum of music, and their only limitation is that they won't play music that you can hear on mainstream radio.

Their specialty shows kick major ass.  I especially like Route 78 West (honkey tonk and trucker music), Beats from the East (contemporary Indian and Bollywood music), and the Local Shakedown (local music, duh!).  They sponsor local music events, showcase up and coming bands, and give a ton to the Denver/Boulder music community.

Sure, the DJs can be pretty sloppy and amateurish, but that's part of their charm as they're not pros, just music lovers.  And yes, they're an AM station that broadcasts in mono (listen online for the full stereo experience), and yes, they have to power down when the sun goes down, but that just makes you appreciate it more.  You never know what you're going to hear.  You might love the current song and hate the next, but you'll never get bored, that's for sure.

Viva the AM revolution!

Cheers!",1

I also like that the person who works there lets you walk around and doesn't bother you. Cutest stuff and I always leave wishing I lived in some extravagent house by the ocean, I would decorate it with everything from this place. Last time I was there I bough a beautiful handmade panel for my bathroom (beach colors) and it's one of my most favorite things I own. 
There is also a building in the back that has lots of cute stuff.

"1343",4,"I got the grilled chicken. It was really good and they have unique toppings like goat cheese, spinach, and cucumber. My husband got a burger. Again the topping choices are great but he said it was not seasoned as well as it could be-5 guys is better. The smash fries are...different, very heavily seasoned. The shakes are yummy, the Hagen daas ice cream makes a difference.",1
"1344",5,"Compare to other metropolitan cities, Vancouver always lacked drinking holes with any sort of uniqueness. I'm glad this geek-themed bar finally opened up on the Drive. A nice collection of medieval weapons hang on the walls, and unique pieces of sci-fi posters and memorabilia are scattered throughout the bar. I didn't get a chance to see the list of games they have available to play, but some people behind us were playing the Game of Thrones boardgame.

The food menu mostly consists of meat sandwiches and vegetarian appetizers (I have expected big hunks of medieval wild boar legs to be the house specialty but oh well) . I ordered a mac and cheese styled spatzle and it was very good.",1
"1345",5,"Great gourmet burgers (all natural beef) and crispy hand cut fries.   Service was excellent too.",1

"1347",4,"Halloween costume madness has already begun at Dressew.  But that also means the store is a magical wonderland for anyone looking for burlesque supplies!  They currently have a wall of feather boas. A wall!  And there are gloves and stockings and wigs galore. I even got a cute little captain's hat. 

The decorative fabric and notions section is awesome. Though the nice girl that was cutting the material for me claimed they hate cutting sequined trim. Oops, sorry girl, I had a few of those!  The selection is the best I have seen and the price is good. I went a little nuts as I had so many costume ideas running through my head. 

As many have mentioned, the hours suck, and that is the reason I am only going 4 stars. I actually had very friendly service while I was there. I was amazed! Other trips have been less friendly, but maybe they aren't overwhelmed with the Halloween shoppers just yet. Give it a couple weeks and I'm sure they will all be grouchy. 

It is a pretty overwhelming store, so it is best to go in with a plan, or you'll walk out with more than you imagined.  And for you last minute Halloween shoppers, they have plenty of ready-to-go costumes.  Provided you like going as a ""sexy"" cab driver, or any other profession you can think of.",1
"1348",5,"Stumbled upon this little gem of a restaurant, great fusion tacos and the kimchi fries are delicious! The concept is great with Mexican, Korean and Vietnamese fusion. 

I had the Bhan Mi with lemon grass chicken; the sandwich was a nice blend of flavors, the veggies really pulled the sandwich together especially the jalape├▒os they had a kick. 

They also had a great selection of sauces to try; varying from Mexican sauses such as green chili to Vietnamese red chili sauce to go with the all the menu items. Speaking of the menu they have a wide selection of different fusion items from tacos, burritos and burgers with splaces of Korean and Vietnamese flavors. 

I'm definitely hooked and will be back for some more!",1
"1349",4,"My friends and I were from out of town and decided on this place for a unique fusion experience and we were hungry. As we were reading over the menu outside, Joanne greeted us at the door to let us know if we had any questions that we can bother her. She was super sweet, which made the whole dining experience extra enjoyable. She recommended the street noodles, which I added bulgogi and it was delicious! Actually, everything we ordered was good. The noodles were made to be dry, but it was so moist and the ingredients melted well together. We also ordered kimchi fried rice with a volcano roll. You can really taste the freshness and crunchiness of the kimchi amongst the well-cooked rice. The volcano roll was excellent. Honestly, Joanne  and the food would make be come back whenever I am in town.",1

+ : awesome space, good music, delicious food and coffee
- : not enough outlets and worst of all - NOT free internet.  

Internet actually not a huge rip off, you can pay by the hour and by the day or buy a monthly service.  Monthly service will bill you until you cancel, but by the day it's only for every day that you actually use it.  I think the daily rate is like $10-$12?  But seriously is it necessary to charge for an hr?  There should be like a free 30min-to-1 hr allowance.  I have no problem paying to use it for a long period of time but 30min to an hr should be free",1
"1351",4,"I was impressed with brown bag. Great atmosphere with plenty of options. They have many different sandwiches, sides and desserts. I split the Bens black and blue sandwich and another sandwich of the week. Both were amazing. You can taste the quality of each ingredient. The sides are also not something to be overlooked. I went with a side sweet kale salad but it was hard to settle with that with all the other options available. The part I was disappointed with was the desserts. I had a red velvet cheesecake bar and it was lacking in flavor. It looked good enough but didn't meet expectations. This is the same price as panera or other fast casual chains but so much better. I would return.",1
"1352",5,"I came for the music.  I was so far from disappointed.  The performer was a fabulous singer as well as an entertainer.  The fish and chips were good and the service great as well.",1

They have a happy hour burger with truffle fries that I have dreams about, and their drinks are well made. I've also been for dinner and can say I have never had chicken cooked so well that was not fried, it was juicy all the way through and no part of it was overdone. That along with it's unique jam/condiment pairings make it a great choice for anybody who is up to try new things.",1
"1354",5,"So, this was the second time I dined at Eddie V's, the first in its downtown location which was excellent.  

Everyone knows that the food is excellent which pairs properly which its pricing.  
 
This holiday dinner was planned by a friend of a friend therefore I had no say in the location.  Our waitress, Mary Kay was attentive and informative.  The venue was decorated nicely, average volume and very busy.  Parking was simple. 

The 5 star service experience further cemented when I did not receive the side dish I initially ordered.  By the time I noticed the oversight I was rather full and didn't need or want it.  I told the server that it didn't arrive which was truly not a big deal.  I was asked if I would like it and they would rush it. I didn't, so I refused. 

The manager arrived at our table shortly before dessert was served to apologize profusely concerning the oversight.  I was not disgruntled in the least but our desserts were comped nonetheless.

"1357",4,"I had the 'Jane's Not So Plain' burger it was delightful! My boyfriend got the 'Dirty south' burger which has mac and cheese, bacon and BBQ sauce and it was amazing! The fries were delicious and you could try one of their signature sauces. The service was great and they were pretty quick to bring out our food. The only downside was that it gets very loud inside which makes it hard to talk with your party.",1
"1358",5,"Really impressed with the food! Jazz was a fabulous waitress. Had a lot going on, but took care of us and checked on our table frequently. Judd the manager is really awesome and asked us how our meal was twice. Very pleased, will be back again!",1

"1361",5,"When I tell someone I live in Sanford (which I usually follow with the phrase ""It's not as bad as you think...""), they seem to usually say ""Oh yeah, I love that German restaurant"" as if it were a natural reflex. That being the case, it is safe to say that the Willow Tree has become a local landmark.

Great place to sit outside and have a beer while feasting on Schnitzels and sausage (expect to take a box home)! Sit inside if you want to focus on the music/entertainment and sit outside if you would rather chat with your dinner companions.",1
"1362",4,"3 star for food, 4 stars for the nice casual service and the ""early bird"" breakfast choices. I, unlike most Portlanders, prefer my breakfast before 9am and it is great to be rewarded with a menu with lower prices and not to mention no crowds. Coffee was a bit on the weak side.",1

My eyes were big, but my stomach was much much bigger.

"1366",5,"This restaurant was amazing. The seafood is sensational. The oysters are worth the price. We ordered two rounds and ate every oyster. The lobster rolls were phenomenal. I never had fresh lobster before coming here, and after trying some, I was blown away. The wait for the indoor restaurant was very short and we were seated almost immediately in comparison to the outdoor restaurant with live music. I definitely suggest this as a must-see for fresh seafood right on Boston harbor. The walk to get here if you're over the bridge, is quite pleasant and worth it.",1

This place really pulls off what they're meant to do well. There's little more to say. Its the perfect cookie place if you're feeling guilty about living sustainably. The business is run as green as they possibly can.

"1369",5,"I just do not understand all the hate for Wonder Spice. Personally, it is one of my very favorite places to go for lunch or dinner. I've been here many times in the past few years, and have always thoroughly enjoyed my meal. In fact, whenever my family is visiting from New York (or my boyfriend's family, for that matter), we head right over to Wonder Spice for a wonderful, relaxing meal, served by some of the sweetest women you'll ever meet. 

The portions at Wonder Spice are quite generous, and their dishes often serve as two meals (or one very delicious, belt-busting, carb-overload meal). Definitely excellent value. I have tried several of their vegetarian dishes and have never been dissatisfied. The vegetables are large, fresh, and cooked very well: always nice and crunchy. Plus, you get a great variety.

I do agree that the flavoring of the dishes can be very light, which is why I ask for the ones marked as ""spicy"" to be prepared ""extra spicy."" I don't mess around with spice; I want to sweat, and make that clear. A little red chili paste can work pure magic.

And if all of that isn't enough, here's a little story: Once, when I was quite ill and desperately in need of copious amounts of ginger and garlic, I called in a lunch order at Wonder Spice. When I arrived, I was surprised and delighted to find that one of the chefs had prepared me a (free!) vegetarian-friendly soup to make me feel better. Amazing.",1

Place wasn't too busy, had a nice ambiance. The bartender was very nice and professional. He wears a cool vest and makes a hell-of-a cocktail!

We'll be back to try out the food next time.",1
"1373",5,"New favourite sushi place!

Excellent sushi, reasonable prices, friendly staff, and wild salmon is available.  What more could you ask for?

I had a really good meal here and me and my dinner companion tried a little bit of everything.  Spicy salmon sashimi (wild) with cucumbers, yakiudon with chicken, a couple rolls, gomae, and a Hockey Pucks on Fire roll.  All of it was great.  I loved the sashimi dish, and the special roll was great.  The roll has no rice, but they have made it in a way that the texture is similar and you don't miss the rice at all.  Very interesting.  You pay more to have the wild salmon, but it is worth it.

The atmosphere is nice and the restaurant is clean and pretty.  I hope to return many times.

They accept credit cards, so not cash only.",1
"1374",4,"Popped in one night about an hour before Closing. Found out ,with a stamped ticket, Parking is free for 2 hours. A, plus. Stood in line for about 15 minutes, then the door matron let me in, to stand in another line(very long). Was chatting with a couple in line and, one of them said you can sit at the bar and get quicker service. So I sauntered over to the one remaining seat. The bartender was friendly, took my order. Only waited about 15 minutes and the food was brought out on a metal tray. BTW, they have Stevia and Sugar in the Raw for sweeteners. A-plus. The Burger (a Classic, )was good. Fries were over cooked. Got out for around $16.",1
"1375",5,"Amazing food, beautiful restaurant.  I would recommend trying the bacon wrapped eggs, they were the best meal at the table by a long stride. The menu description did not do it any justice.  Would highly recommend to friends and family looking for a good breakfast and brunch cafe in Oregon",1
"1376",4,"Wasn't sure what to expect - every time I've walked by the place has been relatively deserted - apparently not busy until later - but the food exceeded our expectations. I could've eaten MANY of the beef brisket 'bites'... Delish! And despite not being a salmon fan, the cured salmon was amazing. The modules frites were nothing to write home about, and I wouldn't bother to order them again, but if you're a big mussel fan they were fine. And the crab cake was ok... My husband thought it was excellent.

The wine list isn't great - I had a good Riesling, but despite many taste tests we could only find one red that was drinkable. Local craft beer on tap is a bonus though.

Service was a bit odd - our server seemed new, wasn't really sure what was on the menu - and another server started half serving us half way through the meal, but the two of them didn't communicate at all.

Macarons for dessert were tasty, especially the dulce de leche!",1
"1377",5,"These guys were great!!! I called about 7 different places and they had the best price, on top of that Lissa offered a free mobile service, helped me schedule an appt for the same day and they showed up on time. Frankie and his friend were super friendly and corteous. Awesome experience.",1
"1378",5,"Customers have a choice of potato or sweet potato fries. Despite flavors such as Cheeburger and Canadian Poutine, Chicken Salt and Spicy Wing sauce, the fries are vegetarian (except if you order the baco-bits that come with the Baked Tater fries, also topped with sour cream and cheese sauce. Are Baco-bits even made with meat?) The Tater, by the way, is the crowd favorite, says the owner, Aramis Jordan.

Everything has a heavenly theme, with ""Angels"" (classic fries), ""Saints,"" or sweet potato fries, and ""Archangels,"" or specialty fries. The cones of fries come in three sizes: prices at the Angel level start at Cupid $3.99, Perfect $4.99, and Flock of 3 Cupids for $10.99. Flavors include mayo, BBQ, malt vinegar, ranch dressing and ""wing"" sauce, as well as regular ketchup. Another dollar for the Saints and Archangels, or $13.99 for three.

I tried a few of the combinations, and really, the fries are not greasy; there's no visible oil sheen on the fries, and later on you aren't tasting that bad-oil aftertaste.

The Cheeburger is made with dill, cheese, ketchup and mustard over classic fries, making it taste just like a McDonald's burger. When I think about a Mickey D burger, in fact, I'm not really tasting any beef: it's all about the condiments and the bun. Here, the Cheeburger is just like my early-childhood gourmet creation: a fast-food burger stuffed with fries.

The Festival, with marshmallow and powdered sugar over sweet potato fries, is supposed to tastes just like a funnel cake, but I still tasted the marshmallow. Still a tasty treat, and a good way to get your kid to eat sweet potatoes, right?

I loved the cheese fries with a dose of truffle salt; it was a little too salty, but a nice umami bomb. I tried the world's spiciest chili pepper, in the form of ghost pepper salt, with the mayo -- a thicker, English-style mayo. Maybe the mayo quieted the impact, so while no tears were shed, my mouth was tingly warm for the entire walk out of the mall.

Next time I come, I'll try the Canadian Poutine (brown gravy and mozzarella, still vegetarian) or the French Quarter Cajun fries with remoulade sauce. There's also chili seasoning and cheese on the Arizona Cheese, and Garlic and Parmesan sauce flavor.

When you ask for them, see if they can mix the toppings so that you can get all the fries a little flavor. Otherwise, use your special fly fry skills and make sure each fry gets a bit of topping, even the bottom ones. Or ask for a side of sauce for an extra charge.

I also recommend adding the ""Ethereal"" salt for another 50 cents: black truffle or the ghost pepper for the adventurous; pink Himalayan or smoky Bonfire for the foodie; and for the vegetarian who misses the taste of chicken, ""Aussie"" chicken salt, which is unFowled.

So are these fries a gift from God? Maybe not for those watching their blood pressure. But for a treat when you haven't had fries in ages? Sure. Even better: share with friends!

Im from CA and we dont roll this way! The customers who were hanging out have good personalities too which makes this place tick. Or am I just a nice guy? Here for the Blooms to Brews Marathon weekend and Ill be back!",1

I just want to thank you for your team's wonderful work in supporting our family's biking needs.  We live a few blocks from your SE Sandy shop, which makes it easy for us to get to you, but the real benefit comes when we enter your store and are greeted by your helpful and knowledgeable staff.  It's really nice to have you in the neighborhood.",1

Two building linked together by a bridge. One side is the bookstore, like a Barnes & Noble on steroids, and the cafe (always crowded w/ table hogs & heavy foot traffic.) The other side is where ya get your Harvard hoodie (like Zuck sports) & all things Harvard (represent!), and upstairs from that--the textbook/school supply area. 

Love the sections dedicated to Harvard professor & alumni authors. Something to aspire to.",1
"1387",5,"Best Shwarma in New England hands down! This is where real deal Shwarma carts really began, at Halal Guys on 53rd St & 6th Ave in NYC. I'm a native New Yorker who's been going to Halal Guys for 14 years since their humble beginnings. The owner is a really nice Egyptian man and his original crew were a really nice group of Egyptian guys from my old neighborhood in Astoria, Queens. So glad to see this business flourish on such a grand scale. Haters need to go to the doctor and get their tastebuds checked. There has to be something wrong with your taste receptors. 5 Stars all day!",1

"1390",4,"We came to SeaWorld on our first day, as we knew it would be a shorter visit. There are a couple diffferent roller coasters that are decent, and the lack of line definitely made it worth it. SeaWorld is all about the shows that are offered; we did the dolphin show, sea lion show, and killer whale shows. Each one was better than the next, great production value and theatricals. There was a story behind each one and all actors/actresses were thoroughly engaged in their roles. My favorite was definitely the killer whale show; it seems like they have so much new technology with how the screens function and rotate and made it very enjoyable. All animals seemed very happy, healthy and were very well trained. We had a great time and hope to return again soon!

Best,
Charlie",1
"1391",4,"The staff was cool and helpful, even right before the kitchen closed at 2AM. Wings were OK, maybe a little pricey at $1 per. I had the lemon pepper and they were well flavored and not too oily. Tried one slice of Soul Food Pizza since that seems to be what everyone is talking about. It was a very interesting slice of pizza! I ate it all so it must be tasty. I had mine to go, but Jack's seems like its designed for group outings that involve lots of beer and loud conversation. I'll come back with friends.",1
"1392",4,"These wings are flavored just the way I like them!  I also love their mozarella sticks, Chicken Philly and the Fries.  Can't go wrong here!",1
"1393",5,"First visit and it won't be my last. Lunch was excellent. We had the Mahi sandwich and the pastrami it was perfect. You get a choice of a side. We had the truffle Macaroni and soup. Amazing!!!! Prices Excellent!! Service also Excellent. Highly recommend it!!",1
"1394",5,"The wait was only 30 minutes, meanwhile we sat at the bar for drinks.  The wait staff was knowledgeable about the wine selection and ordered Pinot Noir.  Very smooth, fruity.

The server, Jackson, was quite friendly and tended to our table with excellent service.  The Smoked Salmon was cooked to perfection!  The Oyster, Lobster, Crab and Shrimp was presented with 6 sauces.  My first time trying Oysters was one I won't forget.  

Awesome job Jackson and J Gilberts for a fantastic dining experience.  Highly recommended",1
"1395",5,"I stepped out into Eden East during the Fall season and had the most delicious, savory, fresh, and homey farm to table meal. Decorated with beautiful assorted lights, Eden East gives you that warm fuzzy Christmas feeling. The tables are decorated with various home-styled plates, cups, and silverware that will make you want to go back to grandma's house. 

Using farm raised produce and meat from their neighbor Springdale Farm, Eden East served us a one of a kind meal. They served us an unforgettable Cranberry Holiday Tea that I still crave while currently writing this review. 

Eden East is all about the family meal atmosphere: sharing large dishes with others. The pumpkin soup was placed at our table in a gigantic bowl. Awkwardly using a tea cup as a ladle, I silently scooped some soup into my bowl in front of everybody. Everyone else followed and it soon became an interesting conversation starter. The pumpkin soup was bursting with flavor that I scooped up 4 more bowls, no guilt.

The salad served was a seasonal slaw with roasted garlic aioli. Each bite was full of fresh crisp flavor that made me not want to buy packaged greens ever again. 

The handmade baked Mac & Goat Cheese was well balanced; it was baked perfectly and the cheese wasn't overwhelming.

The Whole Roasted Chicken entree was of course the main attraction. The meat was deliciously moist with every bite. I don't think I could ever make a delectable chicken like Eden East.

Executive chef Sonya Cote really outdid herself with this meal. For dessert, we were handed sticks, marshmallows, chocolate bars, and graham crackers. Everyone instantly ran to the fire pits and started roasting their marshmallows. Squatting down next to the fire huddled up with everyone felt cozy. Seeing everyone smile and laugh felt warm. Being at Eden East eating great food felt right.",1
"1396",4,"i'm coming out of ""retirement"" cause i noticed some JP thai injustice going down....... as in how the eff does ban chiang house have a higher review than wonderspice. the oooonly thing BC does better is curry!! it's like not even a contest.

this is not like super mindblowing thai food, but it is GOOD thai food, and it's right by my house. the service can be a little slow sometimes, but they are always super duper nice to me. whenever i order a vegetarian entree with a meat appetizer or vice versa they always make sure to tell me that it's not a totally veggie meal. i am, in fact, an omnivore but that scores major points. 

i also really like to eat outside on their back-alley-patio thing in the summer.. ah the summer!

like a few other people have said, wonderspice has definitely gotten better since the first time i ate there.. so why not give it another try?",1
"1397",4,"Great place for lunch while out shopping. Everything is plant based but expect it to be delicious too. If you have any allergies or sensitivities, they are actually equipped to tell you what is in the food unlike most places out there.",1
"1398",5,"This is the best freakin thing i have ever done in my life. going on this tour is so fun and interesting, you really learn a lot. Not to mention the charismatic staff and how i could i forget the FREE BEER!  This is a must and i highly recomend going more than once because they change the specialty beers out all of the time...",1
"1399",5,"Great food, AMAZING staff! I have had just about everything on the menu. It's all good!! The food is flavorful and the kitchen staff is creative and original with all their dishes. All gluten free!! Try ""The Burger"" & an off menu amazing dish called the ""Sprint Strips w/Caesar salad"" it's chicken strips done in such a way you'll come running back for more! Also... They have the BEST ""Crab Pepper Cheese"" soup. You really can't go wrong with anything. It's just a fun environment, a spot I will continue to frequent regularly. If you're thinking of eating here STOP thinking and do it!!!",1
"1400",5,"I constantly keep coming back here and its simply because this place is so awesome. I get the same thing everytime because I am picky, but it is consistently good and delicious.

The food.....  OMG.....  Oxtail hash, fried chicken and crab cakes were all delicious...  This is definitely one of our new establishments as we plan to try everything on the menu...",1
"1402",4,"I fly 6+ round trips a year to Curacao and let me tell ya, this airline rocks. I am an elite member having chalked up some mega miles. I enjoy the privilege of upgrades, priority seating and check in. First class ain't too special in all honesty but the larger seats are so nice. The staff are great and things run like clockwork. When they don't well, it's usually no fault of the airline. It's a chair in the air so really, you gotta go with the flow sometimes.",1
"1403",5,"This place is great. They did a great job cleaning my truck. It's a little far from where I live but it's worth the drive. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to get their car cleaned.",1
"1404",4,"As a supervillan intent on world domination I thought that a logical place to grab a sandwich and network with other like minded villains intent on achieving ""super status"" would of course be a restaurant named ""Villains"".  I expected a virtual who's-who of the evil world and all the kids I hated in high school to be there.

Alas.....disappointment.  The staff were nice.  The ambiance laid back and the food was interesting.  Not even one shark with a laser on its head.  Not to worry my food was served hot.  Each Sandwich is named after a super villain and it was fun to try and figure out what stage, screen, or literary work the villain originated from.

The patronage is a mix of the young and the middle aged.

Only criticism is that my food was a little heavy on the salt....but that may be part of the plot to dominate the world by high blood pressure.... I will look into this...

MOOOWHO HA HA HA!

In summary - recommend you try it.",1
"1405",4,"Maybe I am just superstitious, but I believe the downtown location has the best tasting burgers. Average waiting time has been about 40 minutes. Most of it is outside looking out at Congress with the neighboring bar's live honky-tonk like music muffling on. Drinks can be ordered while you are waiting in line. Occasionally free samples of the food are given out. The people watching on South Congress can be pretty entertaining. The time flies by in good company. 

FYI, there is free parking in the lot behind the restaurant with validation, so parking really shouldn't be an issue.

I come here for the Ahi Tuna Burger. It is by far the best burger on the menu. Both healthy and delicious you also leave feeling lighter and more energized than when you walked in.

I still have wet dreams about the Roasted Banana Shake I was lucky enough to consume when it was on the Specialty Shake Menu. I am hopeful they will add it to the permanent shake menu one glorious and blessed day.

The mixed drinks here are delicious. Every drink seems to have some gourmet flair that makes it extra tasty.

Only downside to this place is it always feels a little pricey going out, and the wait seems to turn me off of going here on the regular as it has a tendency to eat up the entire evening.",1
"1406",5,"This is probably the only Mexican Restaurant I go to, coming from a very Mexican family where we cook really good home cooked meals, its hard to find a good place that almost tastes like home and this is it. REAL GOOD MEXICAN FOOD.",1

The girl ringing me up was very patient and got all my drinks and names right! I just wished I knew her name she was very sweet and didn't feel overwhelmed with my long order like others do. 

I will definitely be coming back and hope that during my next coffee run she is working!",1
"1408",4,"Excellent beer.  Friendly, efficient brewery staff let me try all three of the Electric Bicycle brews.  I thought they were all tasty and ended up getting a pint of the Apricot Wit.  Very refreshing.  Growler fills are reasonable.

A few doors west from the equally excellent R&B and close to Faculty, Brassneck, Main Street Brewing, Big Rock and BeerHall (formally Steel Toad).  Great area for a crawl!",1
"1409",5,"I have been coming to Portland Healing Space for nearly 6 months and have loved every session. The staff is incredibly warm and welcoming and the overall energy is very loving and pleasant. 

I always see Danielle for acupuncture. Simply put, she's amazing! Danielle is a true healer with a very positive energy. Her combination of energy work and acupuncture helps me to recalibrate my mind body and soul, especially in times of intense stress. Her work has helped me reach really deep states in my sessions, physically feeling and seeing the energy move around. I always leave her healing space feeling very relaxed and with a sense of optimism and happiness. It's truly magical. Plus, I always enjoy our chats about the healing, plant-based lifestyles, the cosmos, and whatever random facts pop in our heads.

I stay incredibly busy with my career and hobbies. An hour session every 2 weeks helps keeps me focused, balanced, and calm -- naturally.

Thank you to Danielle and her awesome space and team. We need more people and places like this in the world!",1

"1413",4,"Wide and tasty selection of foods. Everyone at my table ordered sea food and soup so I can't speak for the rest of the menu, but it was reasonably priced and very tasty. Fried banana desert comes in a crispy wrapper and is delicious.",1
"1414",4,"Was not impressed with our service in the bar area!  While waiting on our food. My drink was empty and when I say empty the ice was gone too!  Our waitress had walked to our table a couple of times for other reasons.  And did not offer to refill my drink.  ( i should not have to ask) Our food came out and I had to ask the waitress to refill my drink. Our waitress did not come back to our table until we had finished our food and at the point my husband's drink had been empty.. 
On the bright side our food was delicious! I'm  giving 4 stars because the good was good!",1
"1415",5,"May I begin by saying what a fine establishment this is! The sandwiches are unmatched anywhere in Austin. The atmosphere is so relaxing and a true Austin establishment. Definitely one of my favorite places to grab a bite.",1
"1416",4,"Despite the fact that this place often leaves me with palpitations and I break in to a cold sweat when I am trapped in the corner where the cheese case becomes the yogurt case (every time I'm there) I dig this store.

Shopping here is not for the faint of heart and if I don't get there near when they open, I won't go.  Even my frugality has its limits when it comes to swapping sanity for affordable frozen pizzas. 

But, if you strike while the crowds are not here you're bound to find some great deals.  Sure, the selection is rather limited, but the produce can be great and the place is for sure worth a look.  Just don't say I didn't warn you if you go Saturday afternoon.",1
"1417",4,"I ordered a cup of latte, one waffle and dark chocolate, and Paella.
It was lots of food for one person, but I had to try their waffle as it is well-known. 
We got there at 2:20m and we were sitted around 2:45pm, 15 minutes before they close for the lunch.
I liked the dark chocolate sauce, but it was little bit milky or buttery for me and not dark enough as I love bitterness of the dark chocolate. The waffle was okay, but it could be better if you get a fresh one when they just make it as I got one from the shelf.
I liked the Paella with the sunnyside egg on top of it and I enjoyed it and finished it.
Everything was good, but I did not like their latte.
I bet the restaurant makes good money, but they do not take American express so be prepared to pay with other payment methods.
Will come back for the brunch again.",1
"1418",4,"Great diner open late! 12a-3p on the weekends. Cash only, ATM inside. Extensive menu & specials. Outstanding service. Limited lot parking but more spots on hancock street. I had the eggs benedict, great eggs and hollandaise sauce but canadian bacon was quite chewy, would have given 5 stars if not for that. Overall a great experience and will definitely go again!",1
"1419",4,"My first time trying this place I've seen it all over Instagram. However, I'm vegan and don't consume dairy so I got the slush. It was just like a slurpee in my opinion. 

Also the waitress made us force tip and I don't think she gave us the correct change.
It's still a fun place to try with friends!",1
"1420",5,"This is the best new sushi place in the Cambridge/Somerville area.  The food is carefully prepared and absolutely delicious!  Sushi pieces are huge!  They even go the extra mile -- like laying a thin piece of avocado on top of your eel sushi, or gently searing your uni to give it a cool design.  The tofu teriyaki is not what you'd expect.  It's TONS of tofu, grilled crispy, placed neatly on green pasta with a very few vegetables.  Great if you're in the mood for crispy tofu -- but not what you'd typically expect of teriyaki.  Delivery is FAST and the staff is incredibly kind, patient and grateful for your patronage.  I really hope this place lasts, it's a gem!  Too bad it doesn't have the best location.",1
"1421",5,"Wow...gotta say I am sorta shocked at the negative reviews of this place. But in a way, I guess...good for me. I always hesitate in posting gushing reviews on Yelp, because I sorta wanna keep the place to myself.  So, I guess I won't complain....

Recently moved here from SF, and it has been QUITE a chore to find a really, really GOOD Italian restaurant.

Up until now, even after trying some very reputed places, I had to put Sub Rosa at the top of the list.  Good place, quaint, nice service, very fresh fare but a very limited menu.

I am stoked to have just discovered Il Piatto.  First Italian place I have come across which actually is at the level of the better SF Italian establishments, or a bona-fide Italian trattoria (as in...in Italy...where I once lived, BTW).

Nice interior, kinda romantic, very warm and invitng;  friendly service, good timing on the food.  Great winelist (with a nice hint of irony, I might add).  Our table partook (is that a word ?) in the Calamari Fritti, House Salad, Veggie Lasagne, Fettucine with Chantrelles, and Gambieri...finishing up with their polenta Tiramisu.

Exquisite...all around.

This place kicks.  5 stars.  We'll be back.",1

She is able to listen and take the time to understand my concerns as we try to connect my symptoms and issues to optimize the best approach in decisions with my health.

I've been going to her for about 5 years and have recommended friends who have all had great experiences as well. Even though it's a bit of a commute, it's worth it to know I'm in great hands. I highly recommend her!",1
"1423",5,"Had breakfast here for the third time today. This is one of my favorite brunch spots. The food is hearty, tasty, and fresh- an impressive trifecta! 
The service is always friendly and the lattes are always delicious. We like to arrive as soon as they open so as to avoid a long wait. 
Today I ordered the bueno scramble without cheese. The extremely fresh pico de gallo like salsa, delicate flour tortillas, and crispy seasoned breakfast potatoes that it came with were all perfectly complimentary additions. My boyfriend ordered the diablo and cleaned his plate. He chose the chipotle hollandaise and loved the extra spice it added to the dish. I'm already looking forward to the next time we come back.",1
"1424",5,"I can't get enough of this place. They take so much pride in what they do and it shows in the food and service. It does not get any better than the Breakfast Sandwich with Suasage on Crossaint.  I average one per week and it's better every time I go.  If you want to explore a world outside of breakfast tacos, go get the best handheld breakfast in Austin. 

Outstanding!",1

Good price, very delicious cookies, cakes and many kinds of bread. I stop by at least once a week to pick up my favorite cookies and red bean buns.",1
"1426",5,"Liz Pione was just awesome in helping us find our dream home. As new home buyers, we were totally naive and needed a lot of hand holding. Over several months, Liz helped us figure out what was the intersection of we wanted, needed and could actually afford. She also helped us understand different areas and school districts. As an example, she helped us set up a meeting with the principal of an elementary school. In addition to just being a really nice and down-to-earth person, Liz was always extremely responsive. She even helped us put an offer together while she was out of state and on vacation. I ended up having complete and total trust in Liz. She never pressured us. In fact, she was always encouraging us to go slow and to not overpay in this crazy market. We missed the first property we ""loved"" and we really got discouraged. Not a week later, a much better home came along and Liz helped us to win it.

Can't recommend Liz enough! Don't hesitate to call her up.",1
"1427",5,"I love Wawa. One of the biggest things I miss about my beloved homeland of Pennsylvania, is Wawa.  Every time I go visit my family outside Philly I make a point to indulge in copious amounts of Wawa goodies. 

My favorites include but aren't limited to, House raspberry iced tea, lemon iced tea, almost all the coffee is good and they have about 20 different kinds, turkey hoagies, the sizzli breakfast sandwiches are good my fav is the turkey sausage and egg white and The Philly soft pretzels.  I haven't seen the soft pretzels here in Florida yet but I have been assured they will be migrating south and cant wait.

I've heard alot of people ask what does Wawa mean? The Native Americans around the Delaware valley, present day Philadelphia were called the Lenape and Wawa was their word for Goose.  That's also why their logo is a goose. I know thats way too much information about a gas station but it feels almost like an old friend has moved to town...lol",1

Lisa was not only great at giving the facial, she informed me about my skin type and helped me pick out the best skin care products for my type of skin. I can't wait to go back and I'm telling all my friends and family.

"1430",4,"I had reverse sticker shock while perusing the cocktail menu. $8 for expertly mixed cocktails, are you serious?! I've become almost numb to paying $10-14 for a drink in Boston these days, but Green Street restores my faith that you CAN get a good drink in this town without plunking down a Jackson. The Parisian Orchid reminded me of alcoholic lemonade--a perfect summer drink. Just make sure you tip good 'cause the bartenders are real nice and hardworking. And in case you don't know what such-and-such obscure liquor is, they will kindly educate you in the finer tasting points. I also like that they chill the glasses with ice before pouring your drink in. Nice. 

The food comes in generously-sized portions as my baked mac and cheese entree could easily feed three. The fresh peas and carrots (in the mac) were great. My two girlfriends ordered a cheeseburger and a plate of mussels. We marveled at the size of the homemade chips and sopped up the creamy mussel sauce with the crusty bread. You can really tell that everything is made with fresh ingredients! I think we've just found our new favorite after-work hangout :)",1
"1431",4,"The cod & chips, halibut & chips and the chowder was very good!!! Would definitely return if/when in Vancouver again!",1

"1435",5,"I'm not a huge burger person and was complaining about going here...until I ordered a burger because I was starving. This was the BEST burger I've ever had besides In-N-Out burger. No condiments needed. I will definitely be going back because I'm already craving their burger.",1
"1436",5,"Awesome dumplings.  Try the spicy hot sauce with chicken and pork dumplings with pork bao.",1
"1437",5,"The food at this place blew me away such creative and unique takes on food I was so impressed with each and every dish. 

Now the look and feel of this restaurant needs a women's touch there are some things they can do to make at his place more cohesive.  

I can't wait to come back here and try another amazing meal loved everything these guys truly put a lot of love in creative unique and outstanding flavors.",1
"1438",4,"I don't usually like grilled cheese from other places, besides my kitchen. Outside grilled cheese are either burnt, or do not have enough cheese. Both of those problems I usually have were nonexistent here.

I ordered a safe sandwich, but I still enjoyed it. What impressed me was that even though my order had been put in wrong they didn't keep me waiting, they told me the situation.

The only thing I would complain about is the drinks selection, but the food is great.",1
"1439",5,"You know what you need? A knuckle sandwich. One of our favs! Yay! The days of cash only are over -- they TAKE CREDIT/DEBIT now!! Though the place seriously has a DUDE vibe (which is WAY better on the days when they play metal or classic rock than on the pop or trance days) we come as a family for lunch all the time. We LOVE it! Decadent, tasty old skool sandwiches (forget uber fancy ingredients) all served up on fresh Pearl bakery rolls and bread. 

We always want to branch out but I can't seem to get out of the clutches of the siren's call of the Burnside (House roasted beef, jalape├▒os, red peppers, cheese whiz, crispy onions and pickles) so delish. If you're like me and a total wuss when it comes to heat (though, I have toughed it out a fews times because the jalape├▒os do add an awesome kick!) you can order this without the jalape├▒os and get a mild version of this unforgettable sandwich. The tender au jus soaked beef and onion strings make this sandwich, as does the cheez whiz (sometimes you just need to go trailer park!) The hubs always gets the east sider (neck-and-neck with Bunk for the best Italian sub in town) it's sopresatta, capicola, proscuitto, genoa salami, mortadella, provolone, lettuce, roma tomato, red onion, pickle, olive oil, red wine vinegar and Mama Lil's Peppers all on a Pearl hoagie. (He hasn't been able to venture past this little baby either.) 

The fries are great, thin, crisp, served in a big basket and be sure to get the ketchup in the squirt bottle -- like old 50's diners serve -- allowing you to get the best ketchup to fry ratio ever in the history of man. The chili also gets high marks (though it IS spicy) it is big chunks of succulent beef, rich and yummy you can get it on your fries as well. Our kiddo gets the grilled cheese with cheddar & mozzarella and it is a real treat on their sourdough.

 In addition, to sandwiches they have burgers, breakfast sandwiches, hot dogs, PB & J  and even a burger with peanut butter on it. If you like down home, kick-ass flavor on your sandwiches, lug your cookies over to Knuckle Sandwich -- it'll knock you out!",1
"1440",5,"Great atmosphere both inside and outside and often have fun and talented live, local musicians. Good food and alcohol choices, great smoothies and very friendly staff. I think that this place is very well run and if you sit outside, it's dog friendly and even has water bowls for them.",1
"1441",5,"Wonderful customer service! They have a few unique shrubs and flowers that I haven't seen anywhere else. They also carry zoysia sod by the piece which is hard to find. Most places you have to buy it by the pallet.",1

This place is great, I as able to get a sub at 9am on a Saturday morning!
I got myself a Steak Bomb and it was loaded! It was Juicy... it was magnificaint several hours later when I ate it!  

And  you are probobly asking whether breakfast is available here at this odd hour for Boston... WHY YES IT IS!

Great location by State St at Surface Road by the Aquarium and Long Warf.

Prices were fair if not cheap.... For Boston I found it cheap... $7 for a Steak Bomb is a steal!

Next time I'm in Bean-Town at this hour, I know where to go first to beat the lunch crowds and have a great sandwich!

I was nervous to make the leap and join, but it's been one of the best decisions I've made. Go for it!",1
"1444",5,"I went here for the first time last night and can't wait to go back!! I'm vegan and I went with my mom who is vegan and my uncle who is not. We all loved our food equally. We got two appetizers, the Golden Wontons and the Sea of Love... Both were delicious but I especially loved the Sea of Love. They were so unique! As for entrees my mom and uncle got the Blissful Fried Rice and Teriyaki Angels to share, and I got the General Tso's Divine. The Teriyaki Angels was really good, not a super overpowering teriyaki sauce. The fried rice was yummy but overall pretty basic. The best dish was definitely the General Tso's Divine... The soy protein was fried perfectly and had an amazing crunch and the sauce was perfectly tangy with a little heat but not too much. I'm pretty sure it was the owner who served us, he was so sweet and took great care of us. He even offered to fill my huge hydroflask I had with me which I really appreciated since its hard to find places to refill once you're out and about!",1

"1452",5,"Had the oysters, lobster chowder, fish tacos & toffee pudding. Highly recommend the pudding! It was the best I've ever had.  Everything was absolutely delicious, however I would have liked the chowder to be a little thicker. Overall, great service, great food & great views!",1
"1453",4,"Quality, quality burger.  Full of flavor.  I had the magic shroom.  Noice.  The fries are good, but a little on the salty side.  Cut back on the salt and add a little more black pepper and they'd be good to go.  I don't know how gluttonous you readers are, but one order of fries is good enough for two people.

I'll definitely be back to try other burgers and actually get a shake.  Especially since I know what the hell is going on now.  I made the mistake I'm sure many make when they walk in there:  I saw numbers hanging in front of ""Reserved"" signs on tables and was like, ""Ok, if there's a number obscuring the view of the 'Reserved' sign, that must mean that it's not actually reserved?...""  So I walked up to a table and plucked the number right off.

Totally the opposite of what's supposed to happen.  Waitress came over and learned me on how shit works in there and I felt like a tard.  I'd explain it in detail, but there are at least 50 other reviews that do a satisfactory job.  

However, I really think my system would work better.  Not only does it make more practical sense when you consider the ""Reserved"" sign, but it allows the customer to actually KNOW, without searching around, what table they're supposed to sit at when they come back from ordering.",1
"1454",5,"Best dinner ever. Was not disappointed. Definitely will come back. 

We came for girls night and were very satisfied when we left.

"1455",5,"This is my fabric heaven. There is little selection where I live. Any trip to Vancouver includes a trip to Dresssew Supply. They have so much selection and great supplies. I try to go twice in a trip because I always miss something on the first trip. It can be overwhelming so bring swatches you want to match or a list of your upcoming project. Make sure you have cash or debit as they don't accept credit cards. Also add a little extra room to your planned purchases as you will find something you can't live without.",1
"1456",4,"I've been in here a few times, and overall have been pleased with the experience during each visit.  I ask a lot of stupid questions, as there are many things that I still don't know about fish, and I appreciate not being talked down to when I do ask these questions.  The non-intimidating environment of the place helps.  I've been given a lot of advice concerning tank upkeep and cleaning over the years, and it has helped me out a lot.  The staff is plenty funny and personable (I'm a bit of a regular), and I appreciate that the fish experts are there to answer my nerdier fish questions.  Not a bad place -- it has definitely enabled my fish habit.  I'm glad it has a unique, old-school Portland feel to it.  This sort of place is getting harder to find.  I hope it stays around for a while.",1

I loved the cleanliness, I loved the atmosphere, I loved the professionalism.  
The Staff (Pamella did my Mani-Pedi) made the experience that much more worthwile since she handled both my nails & feet with care.  She took her time and inquired if I was comfortable on several occassions throughout the service.  Yes, the visit was a little time consuming but I was there on my own leisure time to relax and enjoy the services.  I was in no hurry but instead appreciated the time spent in such a relaxing place.  If you just want a quickie and out the door then this would not be a place for you, as they are NOT slow but they DO take the time needed on each individual client.

She listens to my ideas about color and gently guides me to a choice that will not only work with my skin tone but also not damage my hair. Her haircuts always look great and grow out nicely.

I had family staying here, so I met them for the breakfast buffet. I was surprised at how crispy the bacon stayed and how yummy their egg frittata was. I pretty much liked everything I tried here. 

It is a buffet, and the food *does* sit out, so I mean there's that. It's good for what you can get and I'd come back again to have the breakfast.. and maybe the lunch or dinner. Plus, it had a nice view of the river too..",1
"1466",5,"Roe is a fish lover's dream dinner: a seven course meal highlighting one expertly prepared morsel of fish at a time. Is it expensive? Yes: dinner for two will easily set you back $350-400 if you include tip and beverages, and that's not even considering the wine pairing ($85 each) Was it worth it? Yes, I think it was definitely worth the experience of doing this dinner once, but I probably won't be back. We loved every bite of food we had and the wines which our server helped us pick were fantastic, pairing very well with the food, but I wasn't really blown away by anything after the ""Introductory"" course. This is just a personal preference - when I dine out, especially when I spend a lot on a meal, I want to be wowed by how good the food is and how different some of the tastes are. 

For me, I found this in the introductory course, but not so much in the remaining five courses of fish. They were all expertly executed preparations with some kind of sauce, but it all seemed like something you might be able find somewhere else (although it's unlikely anywhere else would be able to execute so well on all five different types of fish). The cheese and dessert courses were good, but I honestly don't remember them, only a few days later. I also love fish, but I found myself wishing for some more vegetables, just to refresh my palate. A lot of our dishes were rich - due to the fish itself - or the preparation. Nonetheless, the food was absolutely delicious.

Service on the other hand was a little strange sometimes. We were greeted in the waiting room with some sparkling wine and waited just a few minutes for our table. Then our server was with us immediately, checking in to help us choose wines. Various people delivered the food to the table and I think some of the personal relationship we had started to develop with our server disappeared. Nonetheless, everyone had a great attitude and attention to detail - no matter who was serving, they made sure we had water and the right silverware. It was disappointing however that my coffee at the end of the meal came very lukewarm, given the excellent attention to detail everywhere else. Overall, a good, long meal (we were there for 3.5 hours) where we got sample a variety of fish and were happily full afterwards. It was definitely a memorable date with my boo.",1
"1467",5,"Our puppy was diagnosed parvo positive two days after rescuing her. An estimate for hospital care at another facility was outrageous. Parvo puppies take days of 24hr care which can really add up. Luckily we found RAH and rushed her there. It was a long wait but that we expected since it is an emergency room. Our little pup fought hard and won her battle with parvo. RAH was great, the three days cost less than one anywhere else! The care was great and they didn't mind us visiting and calling often. Worth the wait it you want quality and affordable care for your best friend!",1

Got two mini waffles with the pistachio rose water dipping sauce and the wild berry one.  Sauces were amazing and the waffles were just as good! A must when at Medina cafe.  Got the frittata for main course and it was amazing! The tomato's were perfect  do yourself a favor and just wait to enjoy!",1
"1469",4,"We were looking for a Mexican Restaurant close to home and found El Patron online. We were greeted promptly upon entering the restaurant and sat right away. Service was very prompt as well. The restaurant was very clean and had a nice decor, and TV's in the bar area if you wanted to catch a game. The food came out very quickly after ordering, and the ingredients seemed very fresh. I ended up having carnitas tacos and my wife had the Patron Fajitas. The food was very good, not the best Mexican we have had but definitely not bad either. We also enjoyed some Margaritas which were very good as well. All in all, the food was a little on the pricey side for Mexican, but keep in mind you are right in the tourist area by Disney, and it was very good and service was excellent. The food is a little more upscale from what I would expect at most Mexican restaurants as well with very high quality ingredients. It is definitely a place that we would revisit.",1

For sides, they have the best cheesy potato casserole and black bean pico.  Today, I overhead them say there was a new recipe for the banana pudding, so I tried it.   It was AMAZING!   Not that the original recipe tasted bad, but they now have a homemade recipe to get rid of the trans-fats in the original.  Good move!  I'll order it again.",1

Flirtations:

Avocado daiquiri - hints of a vanilla milkshake with a little citrus and rum undertones.  Full on comforty goodness, tasted like a hug.

Rhubarb cooler - Oh, hello gin, lemon, n rhubarb syrup.  Come here often?  Oh good, I'll return and accidentally on purpose run into you.  *wink*

Ad lib - vodka, lemon/lime juce, and muddled cilantro martini.  Cilantro-y.  Good thing I like cilantro.  Not a love connection, but it's me not the drink.  

Charlie - tequila, raspberry puree, harlequin orange liqueur, and lemon lime on the rocks, so it was kinda sour, but had a red lipstick hue, that made me want to smooch it.  Pucker up for Charlie in more ways than one!

Enjoy 820's creative eclectic cocktails!  Fun waitress that handled our big party with separate checks, we ordered food and drinks all night; there was minimal/no confusion, she was a pro!

They also have quirky and cool art available on their walls for purchase. Tin Shed is also VERY dog-friendly which I can appreciate, as a dog fan. I definitely recommend this place, it'll take you to Flavortown, since Guy Fieri's been here as you can see from their sign.",1

Even though it is a bit too high in sodium, the flavors alone trump the excessive sodium content and allow me to award this product 5 stars.

It was really incredible. Now the food. I hate seafood in general. I really don't like it. I still loved the seafood they served at the Flying Fish. The food was all fresh and didn't have a fishy taste. Even though I hate seafood, I loved every bite here at the Flying Fish. The Flying Fish is an incredible restaurant and I am still debating whether it's my favorite restaurant.

The #14 bowl is massive. On most days I can share it with my roommate and still be full. On bad days (Saturday mornings), I can finish the #15, which is a big bowl in itself, but much smaller than the #14. My boyfriend finished the entire #14 bowl. If you have the appetite of a small bear like he does, I think coughing up an extra dollar for the extra big bowl is worth it.",1
"1494",5,"Had an amazing time here the other night during happy hour! Alma was our server and she took great care of us ! She mentioned a few features that were off the menu, so happy we took her recommendation! We had the best sparkling rose, and only $40 for the bottle ! The wine list is great and super approachable, service was great, what more could you ask for ?! We'll be back soon!",1
"1495",4,"Can be a little backed up at times, but this place is great. The Coppola add cheddar! So good! The almond pesto aioli is super good. The sourdough bread is a great pick too miam miam",1
"1496",5,"I used to live in Doraville (3+ years) and this was my go-to nail place. It's located in a strip mall behind McDonald's. It's nothing upscale but more a cozy, casual place. I still try to go here when I'm in the area. The ladies are super sweet and do a great job on the pedicures. 

They also do eyebrows here, both waxing and threading. Wendy does the threading here so you need to request her if you want threading vs. waxing. She was the first person who has ever threaded my eyebrows and she does a phenomenal job. 

My normal routine was to have a mani/pedi and lunch or dinner at Mediterranean Bakery & Sandwich next door. This is a relaxing and satisfying combination I highly recommend!",1
"1497",5,"This place is different and the food is great. I love the decor and the staff is amazing it nice and attentive. Will definitely be back soon.",1
"1498",4,"I stayed at the Holiday Inn in the same building, and was too lazy to walk to get food. But this place surprises me. Their fish burritos is GOod, it's got crust around the filet which they put inside of the burritos to give that crunchy-ness. It was worth the 15 minutes wait for one burrito.
However, the portion isn't as big as the ones I have down in Texas,  Los Angeles or New Jersey, but it was enough to fill my tummy, and I'm a 6ft tall guy. So if you are super duper hungry you might have to order two",1
"1499",5,"I am not new to yoga, but I am definitely not consistent with my practice. For me it's all about finding a place I feel at home. I Definitely have that at yoga con amor! I have been to dozens of different studios and yoga con amor is one of my absolute favorites!! I love Dottie! Her classes are always different but still go through the basics. It keeps me interested and hungry for more! I've found myself actually missing it when I miss a class which has not been the case in my practice thus far. Really loving my experience so far! Looking forward to my next class!!",1

Upon entering, I'm always greeted with a pleasant ""Good Morning!"" and a smile.  What can I say...second to coffee/caffeine, this is the early morning remedy there is!  

The 3 floors of brand new equipment give you plenty of options and you hardly ever have to wait to find a machine you want.  As alluded to earlier, the staff is very friendly and helps to add to the positive vibe.  I particuarly love the fact that they have both a swimming pool AND basketball court, giving you that much more variety for keeping up your health.

For those of you who enjoy watching the news, sports, cooking shows...every cardio machine has a tv, not to mention the big screens strategically placed throughout the gym.

The ameneties in the dressing rooms/showers are excellent...lotion, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, and everything is kept very clean, with ample towels at your disposal at no additional cost.

The location is great for those of you who live/work in the area, as I can stop in on my way to the office in the morning.

I haven't tried any of their classes to date, but do see a large number of people coming and going from them which indicates that they must be well administered.

All in all, very pleased with my decision to join, and would suggest it to anyone interested in finding a nice, clean place to workout!",1

I've experienced many flavorless or just plain bad veggie burgers but the Portobello Mushroom Cap burger was spot on. I was told the beef burgers are delicious too! We rounded out the meal w/ fries & house made lemonade. So good!!! We were stuffed so we ran out of room to try one of their frappes, maybe next time!

Don't be discouraged by the long line, it moves very quickly for self-service, sit down and quickly for full-service. The staff was warm and welcoming  & actually seemed to like their jobs! The restaurant has a cool vibe & is super clean...even in the bathrooms. 

Whether you're coming from 3 miles away or 300 miles away, Wahlburgers doesn't disappoint! We even got to meet Chef Paul & take pictures w/ him! Can't wait to go back!",1

Take a seat.  Seriously, that's what a big sign inside commands, and it's what you should feel comfortable doing.  The place has a distinct Portland feel based on its intrinsic atmosphere, the staff and the clientele.  You'll be helped promptly and pleasantly.

If you've brought friends, you've come to the right place, and everyone can share a big pie.  But, even if you're just by yourself, they're happy to cook you up an individual slice of your own (plenty big for a meal).  You'll have about ten different types of slices to choose from.

They're open until midnight, too - how's that for fun?!",1

Jaqueline is by far the most attentive person that has ever worked on me. Sometimes I don't even tell her what exactly is bothering me, yet she finds it and works out the kinks. I bang myself up a lot and she's always the first person i message. I wish I were more eloquent with words to describe how incredible, caring and attentive Jaqueline is. If I could give 6 stars I absolutely would. I'm almost hesitant to post this because I thought she was my own personal hidden gem! Dangit!",1

This is a casual ride that takes you throughout history with dioramas depicting various scientific and social accomplishments of us humans here on the planet earth.  As you ascend the interior of the orb you progress further down the timeline until you reach the top:

The vastness of space and potential before us all!

It's narrated by Judi Dench (think ""M"" from 007 movies), and her English accent blends beautifully with the narration.

It'd be cool to modernize this ride a bit as we've accomplished many breakthroughs in the realms of science and space in the last 3 decades.",1

"1509",4,"I have flown Delta many times, as I frequent Daytona Beach and often it is the only airline that flies there. I have had mainly very good experiences with them. I especially like their game section on the personal monitor that comes with each seat. There is a trivia quiz which makes the flight go by in the blink of an eye. You play against other passengers on the flight. On my most recent flight my husband and I were seated separately. We played each other and it was beyond fun anticipating which ones he would get right. The crew couldn't have been nicer, and to their credit the peanuts they offer are not overly salted.",1
"1510",5,"I rescued my cat Cosmo less than two weeks ago from the Orange County Animal Shelter and he was having some definite issues- though not in personality though :) I had never had an animal before and was clueless as to how vet visits go and what happens with them (expectations, fees, what to bring, etc.). Upon entering Westmonte I felt so welcomed- the staff all care 100%, everyone is personable and professional, and there is a true warmth to their care. They followed up personally and even sent a lovely card in the mail. Highly recommend! I have decided that even though they're in another county they're who I want caring for my pal. :)",1
"1511",4,"This La Fonda is quite possibly the smallest one in town, but it's just the right size for Candler Park.

Have a seat on the enclosed patio if you can, because this place is so small when you sit on the inside you sweat almost as hard as the cooks who are pretty much right next to you!  But if you have to sit inside, grab one of their tasty ice cold margaritas!

I really do not like Mexican food, but Cuban food has my heart.  I love their chunky, fresh salsa- I could almost drink it, it's so good!  And I also enjoy their vegetarian rice and black beans that comes with most meals- refried beans always make me feel dirty inside, if I even eat them at all!

Whenever I go here with friends they always order the fish tacos, and they moan and roll their eyes with each bite, as if they are in complete ecstacy.

I like the veggie burrito filled with all sorts of fresh veggies- they even have artichoke hearts in it!  And they will vegan-ize it right every time, I have never sent a plate back for having cheese in it.

It's so refreshing not to feel like a lead balloon is residing in your stomach after eating here, and the view from the patio is of the new, gorgeous Fellini's and, of course,  the Candler Park residents walking their precious pups to and fro.",1
"1512",5,"This place left me with a food coma.

If anyone in Vancouver ever asks for a burger joint, I'm immediately going to tell them about Romer's Burger Bar.

The burgers are the absolute highlight of this place. They use brioche buns, freakin' genius. Gone is the day of sesame buns. 

I had the BBQ Spiced Burger, which was a May 25-31 special. Too bad it isn't a regular item on the menu. Thing was delicious with the deep fried jalapenos and porchetta inside. I heard great things about the Chicken Green Chili burger, the Magic Mushroom, and the Righteous Rib. 

The beef patty definitely feels and tastes handmade. It is just so tender and crumbles when you bite into it, as it should. 

You absolutely cannot leave here until you try the Drunken Doughnuts, which comes with three alcoholic dipping sauces: Maple Whiskey, Nutella and a Lemon. Maple Whiskey takes the cake, followed by the Nutella. 

The truffle oil fries and onion rings were also solid. Beer selection is good and tasty.

Service was very nice and friendly. We tipped the waitress well and she actually came back to say thank you.

I will be back here whenever I'm in the area for SURE.",1
"1513",5,"I think I've been too stingy with the 5 star ratings, so here we go!  I've been twice now and loved it both times.  I drive down Braker all the time, and saw the ""Roaring Fork coming soon"" signs.  They were next to a building being constructed right on Braker, and I thought, ""That's a weird place to put an upscale restaurant.""  Turns out the building under construction is a Capital One Bank, and the actual restaurant is tucked away off the main road overlooking Quarry Lake.

The food is just as good as the downtown location, but I the decor and outdoor patio make this location a step above.  Their happy hour is fantastic with great wine prices and delicious apps, but it's worth sticking around to try to the main courses too.  One night when we were there, I had the fish special - swordfish on top of home fries, bell peppers, and onions with a fried egg on top.  So unique and so good!  The pineapple upside down cake with Amy's ice cream is a great way to end the meal.

Roaring Fork is a welcome addition to the dining scene up North.  If this keeps up, I may never have to drive downtown or south of the river to dine again.",1
"1514",4,"Thanks to Enrique Perez for suggesting this place to me. This is located near Gatorland and has been here for six years now. 
The phone rings off the hook. We sat here and enjoyed the ambience tonight. It's been a rough week, but we always have time to eat and enjoy the evening with some good food.
Love the dining area. I feel like I am in an office. Love it. How have they kept the carpet so clean for so long? All the staff here are very friendly. 
Hot Garlic Wings. This was suggested by staff. Spicy and flavorful. You could smell the garlic five tables down.
White House Pizza. Ricotta, Olive oil and garlic topped with mozzarella cheese and fresh herbs.
Sausage and Bacon Calzone. Wow. This was huge. Had to get it with bacon. I could only eat half of it. Delicious!
Chicken Alfredo with Garlic Knots. @Xobejm picked this one tonight. She loved it.
Zeppolies. I love Orlando and the beautiful people in this world. Todd and his family were here and ordered these and came by and gave me some of his Zeppolies because he was given too many. Thanks man. Perfect stranger being cool. Not often do you find nice people.
Highly recommend this place. The place is clean and the service is awesome. Come and check them out for yourself.",1

"1516",5,"This place is owned by Japanese People, and the food tastes great! Better than any Japanese Restaurant I've been in Vancouver(In my knowledge). The only thing I don't like is that they don't have ""sukiyaki Pot"", which is my favorite food when I was traveling in Japan. But overall, it's great! I recommend it to anyone who wants to try Japanese cuisine, and the price is affordable. 

My favorite  is  ""sukiyaki Don"". They put green onion, beef, toufu, onion and ETC on rice with a tasty Japanese Soy Sauce, yum! It costs about $9.89 (tax included).",1

"1520",5,"I came here due to my friend's recommendation and boy did it not disappoint. I got the veggie croquette on a pita and a side of pommes frites with truffle ketchup. The veggie croquettes super delicious and crispy and the sauce in it was extra tasty. The fries also came out super crispy, but the real star of the show for me was the truffle ketchup. It was amazing. I love truffle and ketchup, but the combination is too good. 

Overall would definitely check this place out if you are in the area. My only complaint is that when I ordered my sandwich, the guy I was ordering from didn't tell me I could add a side of fries to my sandwich for $2 rather than paying $4+ for the small side of fries. But I still give it 5 stars for the food!",1

Great prices on things like spaghetti and meatballs, mussels, clams, and all kinds of things.

I had the steamed egg sandwich on a ""Portland"" bagel.    They have a dock/porch you can eat on.   We hung out on the couch next to the fireplace.     Everything was perfect.    The owner comped our coffee because we had to wait a little longer for it.    My wife and I didn't mind one bit.   We could sit there all day.   We thank you for your outstanding hospitality.",1
"1525",4,"I have a serious Wings Over Brookline addiction.

Guys... their boneless wings. They are just *so* juicy and tender. They're advertised as ""not that processed junk,"" and you can really taste the difference, especially compared with other wing joints in the area. Plus, the list of sauce options is exhaustive -- I recommend honey barbecue, sweet chilli, and honey mustard. Also be advised that even their milder ""Cruisin' Altitude"" Buffalo option has a kick! 

They have great combo options that come with sides and drinks, too, so I would recommend swapping be somewhat bland regular fries for their garlic parmesan waffle or Ranch waffle options. So very tasty!

That said, ""tasty"" don't necessarily come cheap here. The combo packs are the best values, but if you have a large appetite, you should really go up to the one that comes with a pound of tenders (which comes out to about 7 or 8 strips here), and that's going to run you $15 and change, plus $3 for a delivery, plus a tip, so you're looking at upwards of $20 for a meal. I would argue that it's still worth it for the quality, but it's something to bear in mind if you're more of the ""under $20 or no dice"" chicken type (in which case, respect).",1
"1526",5,"Very busy for a Monday late-morning but I guess that's the area. Anyway, the food was delicious, the waiter was very kind and thoughtful.

"1527",4,"Produce Row is great.  Good selection of taps, and they rotate often enough that there is usually something new.  Food is pub food, but a good value.  Servings are usually pretty large, the food is prepared well and clean, not sloppy.

The patio outside would also be nice on the right day as well. 

Prices for the more complicated drinks seem to be creeping higher, but this is one of the rare cases where it's probably worth the extra $$. I've grown to particularly like the 007 instead of a full/half/quarter moon.  

Not too busy either--if the location just north of here on Burnet is packed, you might try down here for a bit more breathing space.",1
"1533",4,"Stayed here over the Independence Day weekend this year.  It's a very nice property, friendly staff, and all around very nice unique hotel. My only reasoning for not giving it 5 stars was the bathroom was kinda small and cramped but giving the hotels round layout there isn't many ways around that.   One thing I loved about this property is the amazing views of the city.  We had a perfect birds eye view of the fireworks from our window. Another huge perk is the hotels proximity to attractions around the downtown area including the aquarium and coke museum. Deffinetly  will stay here again next time I'm in Atlanta.",1
"1534",4,"When traveling to Portland, I got two recommendations for donuts: Blue Star Donuts and Voodoo Donuts. 

The donuts here are excellent, frosted to order. I was a little underwhelmed by the selection, but I suppose when you do something as well as this place does, you don't really need breadth to attract a loyal following. 

I bought an original Glazed Donut and a Valrhona Chocolate Crunch. Both were excellent. I generally not even like my donuts with filling, but the chocolate crunch was great. The glazed donut was maybe even better than Krispy Kreme's but perhaps too highbrow to be the common man's donut. At $2.50 or more a donut, these things are pricey, but are worth it as an occasional treat.",1

The herb parmesan is also amazing.

Only complaint is that last time we ordered it was a little hard on digestive system. Not sure how much or what type of garlic used if fresh or powered but ensure you have no meetings indoors with anyone after. But still very tasty. Pickles that accompany are not so great.  

I would like to try some bowls and the butter chicken they offer. Tornado potato is meh. The ones at PNE are better",1
"1537",5,"Really good atmosphere. You can grab a drink, and the menu is pretty great. Everyone seems to know the fries are to die for and they are being served left and right. There are no reserved tables, so you might have to eat at a communal location. Wait staff is also pretty attractive, and this is no accident. Bowling is awesome, bands are really good. The crowd runs the full range from couples out, NBA players and college bros, but most importantly it is a chill spot for friends.",1
"1538",4,"I was able visit render with a friend from Connecticut, who came to see me while I was on a trip to Boston. She enjoyed her iced coffe. I had the berry tea... it sure was berry-y.

They recently redid the sauna, there are fans now, I especially LOVE the yoga room, it's usually empty and I can go in there and stretch with out worrying about other people watching me. It's true that it's not the cleanest place which is weird because I see the housekeeping staff working all the time.

The boba was perfect, gummy, chewy, yummy. The lemon flavoring was good, not too strong or weak. It was exactly what I wanted on a hot night to refresh me. I will be going back soon!

Boston Tea Stop is cash only. My tea was like $3.60 I believe.",1
"1545",4,"The short of it: you get what you paid for.  

Pros: Super friendly and informative staff.  Very reasonably priced.  Close to public transportation.  Available even during high-tourist season weekends (call for reservations longer than two days).  Centrally located.  

Cons: Bare bones and hot.  We opened the window but it didn't help.  People in the building facing our room figured out that we were a couple and held an exhibitionist watch-the-tourists party across the street.  In spite of the heat, I closed the shades to ""boos"" and cries of disappointment.  Weirdos.",1

(It's definitely helped along by the Gracenote and Counter Culture beans. Yum.) My partner enjoyed his breakfast sandwich and spoke pretty highly of the pourover; the sip he shared left me just as happy.

It's also relatively reasonably priced for the area. You'll still spend $9 on coffee and a bagel, but you won't find the same quality for any cheaper around here.

As in most coffee shops around here, yes, you do have to bus your own dishes; the staff are very kind but also very busy helping other customers. If you want to be waited on, go to SRV.",1

On the weekends it does have a tendency to get really crowded and service can be a bit slow, it's best to sit at the bar or in the main room.
Oh...and they brought back the vegan riblet! Amaaaazing!
They have really good food for a bar, and several vegetarian options.
I love estoria!",1

I love that they actually make their food spicy ---not just white man spicy, but oh wow my esophagus just disintegrated, but I kind of like it spicy.  The ""Chai Ya Noodle"" and ""Drunken Noodle"" are phenomenal.  I've ordered ""country style pad thai"" (not on their menu) and they made it anyways.  The woman who works the register is a sweetheart as well :)   

Also, not ideal for groups because it can only seat 8 people max.",1
"1550",5,"Vassili's was the first place that turned me on to Greek food. I used to live down the street, so we'd come here all the time. It's a nice, cozy little Greek tavern, and it's privately owned. It's not uncommon to be greeted by the owner himself as you enter the restaurant, before your trendy waitress seats you at your table.

Whether you get a window table or one that is further in the restaurant, the seating here is great. You still get a really comfortable and intimate atmosphere no matter where you sit. And there are no tables near the bathroom, so you don't have to worry about that.

The veal is delicious, very fresh and tender, and not too salty. My favorite will always be the prawns in garlic though. I eat these with gusto until I realize there are no more on my plate.

Like most Greek restaurants, Vassili's is decorated from ceiling to floor with details like vines and decorative plates. Beautiful copper pitchers are placed here and there, and the old wooden floor adds to the place's character. It's as much of a treat to gaze around the restaurant as it is to eat what's on your plate.

Service is always great, and the food arrives at a reasonable time considering they get quite busy, particularly in the evenings.",1
"1551",5,"I love their frozen yogurt selection and their topping are epic. While this is a great to visit, finding parking might be a challenge. 

Great experience to wrap a long work day and a great choice to take the kids for a treat.",1
"1552",4,"I only go to Meat and Bread for one kind of sandwich and that's the Porchetta sandwich. I've tried some of their other sandwiches but I found them to be quite dry. The porchetta sandwich give you just the right amount of crunch from the pork skin and savouriness form the delicious pork. The juices from the roast gives you a good amount of flavour. The bread itself is chewy but I would prefer if it was toasted and warm.",1
"1553",5,"The Yum Yum Cupcake truck is one of the main reasons that I will hit up the Maitland Farmers Market or any of the food truck events here in Orlando!

The have amazing cupcakes and are always coming up with new and inventive flavors. I haven't tried a cupcake yet that I didn't like. My absolute favorite is the Orange and Cream dream. The only negative about this cupcake is that it is a seasonal favorite, so I can't get it year round. Other than that I have no complaints about these cupcakes!

Both their cakes and the frostings are spot on! A lot of places seem to only be able to get one of them right. Either the frosting is great and the cake is blah, or the cake is great and the frosting is blah. But these guys have things covered! (get it? covered. ha.) One of my favorite frosting is on their Cookies Got Creamed cupcake. It is chock full of cookie parts and looks like a great big scoop of Cookies & Cream ice cream. I could eat that frosting by the bucket full. Oh yum. 

They also have two incredible owners! Alex & Joey are creative, friendly, outgoing, and just all around great guys. The rest of their staff is amazing as well. Regardless of where the truck is or who is working you are always greeted with a smile.",1
"1554",5,"I kind of don't want to tell anyone about this place, but I always end up spilling the beans when the subject of office space comes up. Great energy, smart people, ""networking"" opportunities in the best sense of the word.",1
"1555",5,"I'm not a big Yelp-er but felt that I should review Drybar Back Bay as I was VERY hesitant to go after reading so many inconsistent reviews here...

This was my first experience with any Drybar.  I can understand the reviews about how the space may be overly crowded at popular times -- my appointment was mid-morning on a Tuesday and I had about a 15 minute wait.  

My stylist was Leanne and she was just terrific.  Very consultative (I wasn't sure which style would work best with my hair, as well as the ridiculous hot/humid weather!) and clearly explained all products she was using, and why.  A pet hate of mine is a sales push at a salon and I didn't once have to say 'oh, I'll think about it' or 'let me see how it lasts today'...  It was clear that I could purchase any product I wanted but it was more clear that Leanne's focus was on giving me a fabulous blowout and lasting style!

I asked about making another appointment and Leanne told me that if I book with a specific stylist, my appointment will be fully honored on time.  So I've already booked my next visit and can't wait!!",1
"1556",5,"Awesome burgers!  Backyard taste, perfectly seasoned, toppings were excellent!  We also had the pork burger which was a treat as well.  Fries are made to perfection and the interior and the patio are inviting.  5 stars at its best!",1
"1557",4,"greasy chinese food, but i love this place. food is reliable, they give you a lot, and it's very cheap. they also have a japanese counterpart that's less greasy and also offers sushi; it looks healthier but i don't like it as much.
good for the price and one of the few places open 7 days a week around mit - they keep the food court open just for these two restaurants. also... the food is slightly addictive.",1
"1558",4,"The vegan pizza here is quite tasty (tons of veggies, just the right amount of daiya), though it could use a little more salt. Oh, $1 pints?! Awesome! It's neat they deliver to nearby parks too; that would be fun.",1
"1559",4,"Forgot to write the review on this.. Was here a few days ago for a friends bday and I must say the place is really nice. Very classy and clean. Everybody was friendly, food was good, service was excellent, there are many different selections to choose from, I would say something for all. If you have never been I would say try it, it's worth the experience :)",1
"1560",5,"WHAT THE FUUUUHHHH!!! Traveled to Austin to visit a good friend and he suggested Gordoughs for dessert and i lost my mind soooo good!

"1562",5,"I have been going to this vet for as long as I've had my dog (13 years), and can only say great things about the care they give, and the people there. We just put my dog down on an emergency visit. It was the most difficult thing I've ever had to do, but the concern and kindness of every person there, from the doctors to the front desk staff, understood completely, and our sadness and tears were met with great sensitivity and comfort.  I just received a card in the mail signed by many there - reading the heartfelt comments through tears. How nice they take the time to do this, when your heart is aching over losing your loved pet. Many people don't understand the very real pain of such a loss, but they do. I can't thank them enough for the love and support they have shown. 

I've had nothing but great experiences at Alpine  - everything from routine visits to more involved teeth cleaning involving anethesia. Dr. Mones is the best, very professional and sensitive to your needs, always giving you options when it comes to treatment and cost, which i appreciated. I know he has gone above and beyond at times, always with the best interest of our dog in mind. I do feel their costs were always reasonable too, and in-line with the quality of care. I will be back if I ever find another furbaby to love. Thank you to all the staff there, you are simply wonderful!",1
"1563",4,"I went here for lunch with my boss and coworker. They both had a salad but I had the chicken salad sandwich with fries. 

My sandwich was tasty, but nothing too special. It was one of those sandwiches that you cans put down because you're afraid all the insides will come out which means it was huge, but still I would have liked to set it down. The fries on the other hand were outstanding! 

I could only finish half the sandwich which is rare for me but took it to go.

My boss and coworker loves their salads and ate the whole thing.

If I'm starving and in the area I might make it back in. Their entree menu looked delicious so I might have to go back for dinner.",1
"1564",5,"truffle fries were great, nice fry, great flavor with the garlic.
burger was well cooked, tasted fresh, well seasoned.  the only criticism i would have is the bun didn't really add anything to the overall flavor of the burger.  the bun was fine, soft, fresh, stayed out of the way, but i didn't get excited to eat the bun (like i do at in-n-out).
beer came out ice cold in a large glass with frozen beer crystals floating around.
we came at 1130am on a saturday and waited about 10 minutes in line.  any later and it gets to a minimum 30 minute wait.",1
"1565",5,"I'm visiting Orlando and needed a fill and pedicure. I walked in and didn't have to wait at all although it's a big place and they were busy.  Peter did a really good pedicure and fill. He was very meticulous and made sure I was happy with his service.  And a got a glass of wine  during it all .",1
"1566",4,"Classic local diner kinda place. Coffee ain't Peet's but above average trick stop blend. 
The pancakes rock. The huevos is my favorite. The breakfast burrito is above average and large. 
Main thing here is the service. Fast. Pleasant. Love it. 
Oh, and it's a clean joint too.",1
"1567",4,"This place is well kept and clean. Trucks are too. Good people. Friendly place. Dogs are welcome. Don't go during Halloween due to the haunted house next door you won't find parking.",1
"1568",5,"The food here was delicious, definitely will be going back to try more of the vegan sushi!",1
"1569",5,"This is my favourite restaurant of ALL time. I think I may have liked it better when it was the size of a closet, but at least now you can sit inside when it's raining. The bathroom wallpaper is worth a visit, as is the artwork on the walls. The menu has grown too, but I stay with the burritos. In fact I stay with the Mr. Jones, the first item on the list. I've never had to try anything else. Fabulous value. Very filling.",1
"1570",4,"Can i just say, thank you so much for opening late. It's a relief to know there are people in Vancouver who don't already snuggle in their bed before 10pm. I know i can always count on you when i'm lonely and needin that sugar high late at night. 
I sarcastically love the weird customer service, it's endearing to me for some reason. Blunt, a bit messy sometimes when it comes to the waitlist, hardly ever refilling my iced water, but it's ok, because i love you.
It can get pretty busy up in there, so you might wanna get there early, especially on weekend nights. 
A couple of my friends hate the food here, but i don't care. They're just haters who are jealous of our special relationship. The chef specials have never failed me. I love the sweet n sour chicken nuggets.
Only ever got iced chocolate milk tea here but it's always good.
This place is versatile as heck, family, date, friends, anything goes.
And it's cash only.
Aw.",1
"1571",5,"Honestly my favorite restaurant of all time! Service and food are amazing never let down!!",1
"1572",4,"Great new addition to town. Spicy dumpling were to die for. Wonton soup was awesome on a cold day. Fried rice was a little bland. Coming back soon, maybe tomorrow",1
"1573",4,"This is a wonderful place to go for lunch or dinner. The atmosphere is beautiful and the food is fantastic. I have eaten here a few times and had several great meals. The Spit Roasted Half Chicken
roasted vegetables, corn bread stuffing was particularly good. Friendly wait staff, and I have never had a wait to get in. The location downtown is also really nice. We went for dinner with friends out of town at the height of SXSW and only had a ten minute wait - we were pleasantly surprised!",1
"1574",5,"We love this place! We have always gone for the buffet. The last time we went we took some ""picky"" eaters (you know, the ones who are scared of anything new-ugh). Everyone LOVED the food! Buffet has always been clean and service is great. The ambiance is not fancy but I like it- it kind of seems like you're in another country. I just wish they had a dinner buffet! Please do a dinner buffet!",1
"1575",4,"The principles that I associate with Tibet are reflected in every facet of the restaurant: simplicity, venerability and balance. We began with the papadums (99 cents! Why even charge at all?) had the Po Tsel  Chura (spinach with tofu) and Tsel Duluma (eggplant with potatoes and tomatoes) as entrees. Delicious. The flavors of each dish were uniform but had depth and the portions were hearty. Unlike some vegetarian meals I've had, we were content, even having enough remaining to take home for another full meal. 

Though simple and casual, the environment is anything but sterile. With woodcraftings, wall sized photos of mountains, stacks of books on Tibet and a jungle of plants, the ambiance has vitality. The service is unobtrusive and keeps the experience pleasant and tranquil. This did not however, inhibit us from having a very animated conversation. The lunch buffet sounds like just what I need to break up the day.",1
"1576",4,"Worth a visit on so many levels.

Food: 
phenomenal, creative and freshest local ingredients
Portions are on the small side, but because the food is so good, it's acceptable in my opinion.  You are paying for quality, not quantity!

Service: 
moderate to great (depends upon your server).  We happened to have a great server, he was excellent.  The bus boy, however (who brought out meals for some tables), was confused and always mixed up whose item went with whom (at a 2 table party)!  But that is an easy fix

Wine: 
nice PNW and international (old world) selections, list is on the small side and 25-50% overpriced.  But on special occasions, it's overlooked.

If you are a foodie, this is a must try.  
If you want large portions of generic food, go to the chuck wagon!",1
"1577",5,"Kongee Dinesty has one of the best congee (rice porridge) in town. Their menu is kept simple, which allows them to keep consistent with the quality of their food and service.  I have been back to Kongee Dinesty half a dozen times for brunch and lunch and still have not been disappointed.  I have found their menu somewhat unappealing for dinner items however, hence I never came here for dinner.  

One of my favourites is the build-your-own congee option from their lunch menu (from 11am - 2pm).  You can pick and choose the contents of your congee and side dish to your likely -- very much like the many build-your-own noodle dishes at places like Deer Garden and Cattle Cafe.  

I have referred several friends to Kongee Dinesty and they share in my opinion that this place is worth a visit when you want a taste of your mom's homemade congee in a relaxed setting (with plenty of parking too).",1
"1578",5,"I love taking in a nice afternoon breeze walking my dog down the trails!  Even on a hot day the trails are covered and about 10 degrees cooler!  

People are friendly and you see them running, walking, biking, etc. up and down the trail!  Plus how can you beat the view, places to sit and take in some scenery or let your dog take a quick dip in the lake!

This is definitely a zen place I go to for stress relief and exercise!",1
"1579",5,"I'm updating my review of 2010 to reflect another two years of great service by this office.  I find them consistently performing at high levels of customer service regarding the patient's health and pocketbook.  If I seem enthused, that's only because I've had horrible experiences with other optometry offices and want to give these guys credit.  It's nice to be remembered by name, and not treated as a number/revenue source.

Doctor Friberg demonstrates clear concern for her patient's well-being.   She takes the time to explain everything she's doing, why, and what the results suggest.  She is clearly interested in making sure the patient is well-informed of the state of their eyes and the options available.   In addition, unlike other Optometrists I've visited she is clearly interested in developing a long-term relationship with her patients.  

Katie and Torrey work the front office, and have been immensely helpful with everything from scheduling, billing, fitting, and repairs.  I had a warranty issue in 2011 and my lenses were replaced quickly and without hassle.  Also, during my last visit i was referred to an outside clinic that has specialized equipment, and they made sure the visit was as smooth and seamless as possible.

Check these guys out, your eyeballs will leave smiling.",1

All of these factors contributed to a meaningful tattoo experience.",1
"1581",4,"Over the last week during the scorching heat, I decided that I need to trim the wild bush on my head. I recalled seeing their advertisement for $15 hair cut + blow dry deal with one of their junior stylist a while ago so I went and visited them.
Unfortunately, the deal is no longer valid but the owner gave me the deal anyway.
The salon is not big but is nicely set-up and all the stylists are very friendly and talkative. The place is also AC'ed (thank God).
Well, I just had my hair trimmed and because it was a simple hair cut, there's not much to say about the expertise (they did a nice job, don't get me wrong).
But the friendliness and the air conditioning made me feel like I was in heaven for a while, lol.
Stylists are very knowledgeable with their product; they actually had answers for EVERY questions that my wife had ; )",1
"1582",5,"This was the first restaurant we went to when we were house hunting 6 years ago and we continue to go and unless something weird happens...will do that for many more years!  We are new to Yelp so no review yet...so we'll pick this past  week's visit to talk about.  First of all, Thanks Theo and Family for keeping downtown Sanford alive.  The business you bring downtown must be appreciated by many of your fellow merchants. Food...good as usual.  Place was PACKED and while we find it normal and it's normal in other places/countries, we saw a person be a little weirded that we were at one end of a long table...sorry guys that's how it's done!  Since it was so crowded the food was slow in coming but it was hot/good/plentiful as usual.  Meanwhile, great music including audience participation and Theo making the rounds table by table...even drinking out of the boot at a couple.

If you want to compare this place with the finest/best German restaurants in the world you're missing the point.  This is a fun, friendly, home-cooking kind of place where you can feel welcome, relax and have a good time.  Lunch, Dinner, doesn't matter.  Sit outside and have a Bit!

Their deli around the corner on Magnolia Square is also good...check that out!  And mostly, make a point of going there or to the other fun places downtown Sanford.  Cute town, great people...",1
"1583",5,"Highly recommend - Very reliable and friendly business. I've been consistently pleased with the service here, the prices are very reasonable and the tailoring service was excellent.

I will definitely come back for all of my tailoring needs!!",1

"1588",4,"I came here for lunch after 1pm with a group of friends and we were able to get seated fairly quickly with a group of 9. On the menu there's two different sections, at the bottom of some of the pages in the menu, there are 'authentic dishes' with Chinese names for the dishes. I highly suggest ordering from this section. We ordered about 9 dishes and did family style to share. The tendon was a good starter. For the main dishes, I enjoyed the basil chicken, ants on a tree (it's the dish's name, there are actually no ants), and most importantly the pork knuckle (which is not on the menu). To order the pork knuckle, you will have to call ahead and make sure they have availability. 

The price of the meal was decent. We had 9 people and 9 dishes, and each of us paid 14 dollars including the 18% tip. Overall this was quite an authentic place for Chinese food if you order the right things. I would definitely come back if I was around the area.",1

"1590",4,"My boyfriend and I have found our favorite spot. We went for the first time last night and we LOVED it. 

When we got there it was super busy, always a good sign. We were told it would be about a 30 minute wait, we were sat in less than 10 min!

Zac had been craving a good juicy burger for a few days. So after some online research of restaurants nearby that had good burgers, we decided on Mystic Station. We were not disappointed! The burgers were so good, and filling! We could not finish out burgers, we each brought half home.

Our server, Thomas, was great. Super attentive, but not overbearing. Hw was knowledgeable and helpful when it came to my boyfriends beer flight selections.

The overall ambiance was great. definitely a step above a bar/pub but not overly formal. We felt very welcome and all of the staff was very friendly. Even when people watching, one of the managers was always touching tables and chatting incoming customers at the door. As someone who used to work as a waitress, this is something that I love to see managers doing.

We hd a great experience and we have not stopped saying that we cannot wait to go back and continue to make this our spot! We are already trying to plan our next date night there!",1

"1592",5,"If you don't know what to eat for dinner or if you're craving great Italian food, Lilly's Gourmet Pasta is probably your best bet around the Mission Hill area. It's convenient for many college students because it's right by the CoF's. Anyways, although Lilly's is a small little place, they sell amazing food for amazing prices. My favorite go to dish is the ziti, with alfredo sauce, and broccoli and chicken. The ziti is not your average penne, but has a nice chewy texture to it, which I personally enjoy. The alfredo sauce isn't too heavy yet it's still packed with flavor. The chicken is grilled and well seasoned, and what I enjoy about the chicken is that it's not dry at all. You can still tear it with fork. Another thing that's great from here is their garlic bread. It's nice and crunchy on the outside, and soft and well flavored with garlic and cheese on the inside. Not too oily either, which is something I can appreciate because oily food just makes me lose my appetite. Another dish that I like is their gnocchi with pink vodka sauce and chicken! Everything is goes well together and is not heavy filling at all. The gnocchi is nice and chewy. The chicken is again, very tender and full of flavor. The sauce is a nice, light pairing with the gnocchi. 

Overall, I really enjoy coming here whether I'm eating at the small restaurant or getting it delivered.",1

We went early on a Saturday around 4 pm so it was not busy. We are both from New York so we wanted to try out their drinks here which the waiter recommended. I forgot the name of the drink I got there but it had rose water in it. The drinks we very good. We tried at least 4 different ones. They were in the mid 10's range each which are pricier than I was expecting, however the ambiance has a more higher end feel. The walls were bricked. This was a nice place!",1

They have many Cardio machines, weight machines, friendly staff and trainers. Feel like walking? Their is a walking track.  I think they should have a larger area for free weights. Friendly members was a huge plus for me. Everyone supports each other. I've been a member 3 yrs and I've lost weight, reduced my med doses and been taken off meds.

Excellent service and food. And yes, it is an old school feel.
It does get loud in the restaurant, but it is worth it.",1
"1605",4,"I love the idea, but wasn't impressed. The fries were nothing special and not hot and crispy like those I had in Amsterdam and Belgium. The sauces are good and waffles too. I wish there were some healthy menu items to go with the less healthy. I'm thrilled Saus is there and wish them all the success in the world! I'm just not going to be a regular customer.",1
"1606",5,"My favorite grocery store in the Metro-Boston area. I live in the neighborhood & always run into someone I know here. And the low prices are no secret! Go in with a list or you'll want to grab all the bargains.

My favorite parts are the exhaustive bread selections, especially all the Portuguese/ Brazilian sweetbreads, and the wonderful, very fresh produce. The produce is always fresher than at the Shaws up the road in Porter and there's a far wider selection. (And it's often half the price). The organic produce is often in better shape than at the Harvest Co-op.

I'm a little miffed by the tone of the person from Brookline who mentioned spoiled goods. Really? Have you actually ever seen a spoiled good at MB? Their turnover is too high for that!

I will say this though: Be careful during bagging! Because you don't bag your own groceries, mixups do happen. I've seen it happen a few times where someone leaves a bag behind/ takes my bag by mistake.",1
"1607",4,"This place is great, but not amazing. We came here during dine out Boston and a 3-course meal was $38 per person. There were plenty of selections for appetizer, entree and desserts with some sides at about $6 each. We were pretty much full after the appetizer and had the leftovers of our entree for lunch the next day. The mint chocolate chip was green (yay!) but suffered freezer burn and tasted more like creamy Italian ice than ice cream. Overall it was a good experience but nothing stood out as amazing.

"1614",4,"The food was AMAZING!! 

I tried the Clay Pit Pakoras and Tandoori Chicken- the chicken was literally the best chicken I have ever had! The food was definitely tasty!  

I suggestion making a reservation if it is a busy weekend -We made a reservation for Saturday night which was nice since it was very full! 

The waiter was good, I felt a little pressure to hurry up even though there were open tables. He was knowledgeable about the dishes and knew what to suggest. 

I liked the feel and decor of the restaurant. It was super load and very difficult to hear the other people in my party and had no idea what our waiter said most of the time. Overall, I really loved Clay Pit and am definitely suggesting it to everyone I know!",1
"1615",4,"I dig this place. I had been wanting to check it out and am glad I did. I got on the Helium mailing list a few months ago and was sent an email offering two free tickets to an upcoming comedy show, I quickly snagged them up! 

Short list of the goods:
The place is small, and nicely lit. There were 2 bars, or lounges surrounding the actual comedy club where you can grab a drink before, and/or after. 
The servers were friendly and service was quick, once we realized there were two separate lines, one for the bar and one for the comedy room. 
The lines moved rather quickly and we were seated right away, once the doors opened.
The actual comedy club part had a very open feel, partly staged seating which gave everyone a pretty good view. I wouldn't say there were many ""bad"" seats in the place.
Drinks were fairly strong, and the service in the comedy club was also super quick and friendly! They did a great job of serving in the dark!  

A few un-goods: 
Two drink minimum, which isn't exactly a bad thing, I support it actually, especially because I got the tickets for free and it was a comedy show, I basically came here to drink!  But take note that if you buy a drink out in the lounge before hand, you still have to buy 2 inside the comedy club. You have been warned. 
The line system in the actual bar part before the show started was kind of confusing. We ended up waiting in the comedy club line, thinking we were in the drink line. Wasted a few minutes of my drinking time, ha. 
The prices for the drinks were more expensive in the Comedy Club than they were int he lounge. When we asked about this, we were just told, ""oh it should be the same, hmm"", but no resolution. We were not in the mood to be annoying about it. lol. 

Over all it was a great night! I would definitely go back and would also say, with confidence I would choose this comedy club over Harveys, any day!",1

"1617",5,"It has been 6 years since my last Yelp review of Pleasant Street Dental, but not much has changed. I'm still a very happy patient of the practice, even after seeing one of the 'associate' dentists that Dr. Richardson was using.

Basically here's the dilly:
- Still an up-to-date office with great technology that makes things easier on you as the patient (x-ray machine, water pic cleaner, etc)
- Hygienist and dentist both listen to your feedback, both about any pain level and questions about treatment
- I don't think they over-diagnose at all; in fact, I have had to request treatment at times. They also will show you on the monitor what they are seeing so you understand why you need treatment.
- Flexible office hours - I love the early morning appointments!
- Friendly staff
- Reasonable prices - unlike Hannah M., I have found Dr. Richardson's prices even with my co-pay to be lower than my co-workers' and friends' experiences with other dentists, especially with things like night guards that aren't covered by dental insurance or crowns, which are only partially covered. I know she makes it a point to try to keep those costs low for her patients.

My only negative is in regards to my grinding problem. Back in 2003, I mentioned I thought I was grinding, but Dr. R didn't see evidence in my teeth so I didn't get a night guard. Let me tell you, I was certainly grinding! Lesson to self: Be more assertive when discussing my own body/health.

However, on the other side of things, when the good dentist did see evidence of grinding in my teeth even after I started religiously wearing a night guard, I wish she had been pushier about the whole ""unconscious day grinding/clenching"" concept, and had more recommendations about how to prevent that behavior so I stopped grinding through my crown. I was in denial about my day grinding issues.

The grinding thing is pretty minor. I am very happy with my dental care at Pleasant St Dental and will continue going there and recommending them to everyone. (And everyone I've referred has been very happy!)",1
"1618",5,"Ordered Due Carni, Grilled Asparagus and Miscelato Cece Salad..Asparagus and Cece Salad were amazing that by the time the pizza was served we were almost full..was dipping Due Carni from the asparagus juice, tasted even more better...Food server Zach was an amazing server as well, patiently answered our questions regarding the area..overall experience, Excellent!",1

The bar atmosphere was great and very attentive for how busy they were. Great beer on tap and a well rounded menu. We ordered the pork egg rolls, Kung Pao chicken, and General Tso's chicken. Everything was fried perfectly! Nothing felt too greasy or dry. I can't wait for them to start doing take out.",1

We got here right as the sun was setting. There are stairs that lead you to the top of the hill, and was getting dark. The view was amazing.... I even chose it to be my profile picture. I don't want to give it all away, if you are ever in the area, come check it out yourself. It is beautiful.",1

"1626",4,"The biscuits are totally unhealthy, BUT SO DANG GOOD!  I'm from a small country town and this place makes biscuits just as good as my home biscuits. I will come back just for the biscuits! The salmon croquettes are also delishhhhh. 

The eggs were just eggs. 
The grits could use a little love, but the salmon croquettes and biscuits win the shop for me. 

The service was great and the basil lemonade is delish! I'd prefer it to be a less sweet personally, but it has a good flavor. 

There are some vegetarian options, but no vegan options. FYI. An area of opportunity for the shop. 

The vibe was also on point. It's fam friendly too for those with kids. I'll be back. :)",1

"1629",4,"This place is SUPER touristy but I must say, I was impressed by their burgers. The way you order is a little odd, I was a little confused whether it was table service or bar service and I would have liked for that to have been more clear. I ordered some kind of lamb burger which was so delicious and their fries are awesome too. Completely over priced for a burger and fries but none the less, good. We ordered a beer from our server who was super friendly and wanted to know all about my stay in Austin! I enjoyed the food and the service and would go back if I had a little extra cash to blow on a burger and fries.",1
"1630",5,"If you have a kid between the ages of ""pulling up"" and ""old enough for organized sports,"" the Tot Lot is for you. Technically aimed at the under 5 crowd, this place is a godsend for parents and caregivers who just. cannot. be. inside. any. more. The structures are fine, but the real appeal is the massive quantity of push toys, ride-on toys, dump trucks, etc. There are even some activity seats for the really young crowd. The community seems to value having these items, so when some disappear after weather and children have taken their toll, new ones periodically appear. Watch your children ""practice"" sharing over the very best ones!

Grab some coffee at JP Licks and head over here first thing in the morning. Or bring pizza from The Same Old Place for a lunch time gathering. Or head out around 11 am to hit the lunch buffet at Bukhara. All in all, this place is a critical part of the rotation of life in JP with kids.",1
"1631",5,"Best milk tea in portland!! So glad they opened a boba place on the Hillsboro/Beaverton side. The drinks to get are milk green tea, oolong milk tea, and kung fu milk tea (milk black tea). I suggest 100% sugar for best taste. If you want more of a tea taste, I suggest 70%. Dont be fooled mango green tea does not actually have real mangos. It only has mango jelly as the ""mango"" flavor.",1
"1632",5,"Can a farmer's market be cozy?  This one is cozy and neighborly. A good overall vibe.  

For a small farmer's market, they have such a wide variety of goods.  You can get fresh veggies at one stand, fresh fish at another, fresh beef at a third, and sample some wine and cheese at others!  There is no lack of fresh bread or baked goods for sale, and even some crafters at the market.  And don't worry if its too hot outside because there is a gelato stand and plenty of stands that sell fresh lemonade.  The place is always hopping even at 2pm or 530pm! I wish their hours were later because it was always tough getting here after work.
There is plenty of metered parking on the surrounding streets and also right off the bike trail.",1
"1633",5,"Delicious across the board. Great homemade white bean & garlic spread to spread on bread. Fantastic homemade tagliatelle with sausage and veggies. Very fresh, perfect flavor of you like a little red pepper hear. The lobster risotto special was also delicious. Service (Rebecca) was very warm and timely & staff was very accommodating to our tired and starving kids. Kids loved the gelato & sorbet that came with their meal. The Molten Lava Chocolate cake was divine. Bonus: a traveling accordion Band came through and played at our table. We were happy to tip them in exchange for the authentic Italian dining experience.",1

I decided to try Domino's again after Pizza Hut ruined my dinner for the last time; I was beyond pleasantly surprised. This is my go to for pizza delivery from now on. The new recipe is the jam and the specialty pizzas are worth a try. My GF is hooked on the Philly on a pan crust. I like the MeatZZa Feast and the ExtravaganZZa Feast. 

10/10 should trust these pizza delivery masters to make dinner happen when you don't feel like cookin'.",1
"1635",5,"Had a fantastic dinner here on a weekday get together with a friend. We chose to eat at the bar since the dining room was full, but were glad we did. The bar looks into the open kitchen which is fun if you're a foodie and like to watch the action up close. The handcrafted drinks were well balanced and inventive. The menu is pricey for the amount of food you get, so expect to spend some money if you are hungry, but everything we had was excellent. We will definitely be back.",1
"1636",4,"Beautiful hotel. 24 hour room service what every hotel needs. The pools are amazing and the hotel bar is very cool too. The gym is state of the art and the staff is great. There are bars and restarants right around the corner so there are plenty of things to do.",1

"1638",5,"Customer Service has been great. I've been in 3 times, had 3 different employees help me and each time has been great! They take the time and listen to what you want, answer questions and try to match you with the best product for your needs not just try and push the most expensive stuff on you (which like everyone else on the planet I HATE!!). I really felt the most important thing to them was helping me to be happy with what I was buying which is why I will be a repeat customer as long as this type of service continues! Thank You!!",1
"1639",4,"Loved the lasagna. My friends and I had the lasagna and no one was disappointed. They prepare the lasagna in a small round casserole dish, which is a bit different and cute. Great presentation. We also shared a scrumptious Burrata. Cocktails were well- crafted and tastey. The location is convenient to the Fox for a dinner before the show.",1
"1640",4,"Ginger Exchange Symphony is a wonderful addition to the Symphony Hall area.  Everyone in my office is addicted to their food (one colleague of mine ate there every day last week) and I've had lunch there three or four times so far.

I've had their ""Symphony Pad Thai"" and it is pretty good!  I've ordered it twice for lunch (one time wasn't enough!) and had it with the chicken one time and the shrimp the other.  I think the shrimp could have been cleaned a little better, but overall, the dish packed a little punch that pad thai typically lacks.  For $8.95/$9.50, you get a nice sized portion and a choice of salad, soup, spring roll, crab rangoon or edamame.  I've had the rangoon (which is delicious!) and the salad - which I thought could have used a little more ginger dressing, but overall it was good.

I've also had their $9.95 two-roll sushi combo for lunch, and once again, you really get your money's worth.  You get a choice of soup or salad and two 6 piece rolls (I had the spicy salmon and the East: shrimp, avocado and cuke).  Considering an 8 piece spicy salmon roll from Whole Foods is $7.95, I would say its a pretty good deal.

The service is quick and friendly - regardless of whether you dine-in or takeout.  The restaurant is very clean and the food is consistent.

Give Ginger Exchange Symphony a try - you won't be disappointed!",1
"1641",5,"these guys are the best. we've brought our two dogs there for grooming for the past year and wouldn't think of going elsewhere. the staff is super friendly and they've accommodated last minute appointments on multiple occasions. and most importantly the dogs always leave looking top notch and all smiles, rocking a new bandanna scarf. (even got a patriots one last fall)",1
"1642",5,"Went here based on other reviews.    Best I haves found in MI/Cocoa beach area.  Had lunch special.   They are a take out place but have a couple tables.  I decided to eat there.   Soup and meal served on China ware no take out box!    Sweet sour soup perfect, Szechuan beef was wonderful.   Finally a place who does fried rice right!!   No yellow rice tossed in a wok.   
Family run place and very friendly staff, maybe owners.    
We will be ordering from them in the future, I have to pass 4-5 Chinese places to get to them but they have earned the business with very nice help, good and fresh food-done right.",1
"1643",4,"This was my first experience to the North End, and after 5 different recommendations from 5 different people about where to eat, we decided to wander the streets going from menu to menu until we found a menu which caught our eye. We would have stopped earlier along Hanover had it not been for our quest to find Mike's Pastry, but luckily we found The Florentine Cafe. There was no wait, and we were seated in a quiet dining room. Service was great, prompt and efficient. My roommate tried the Cosmo but it was very citrus-y and alcohol-y and the waitress returned for a Lemon Drop which was divine. I had the Tortelli dish which was very good, but the cheesy sauce was a little cheesy and my stomach was a little queasy after. It was delicious, but I will stay away from cream based sauces (never have really liked anyhow). My roommate loved her meal (sorry we forgot the name) and finished it off. The rest of the dishes around us looked great as well. 

I read on review about the bread and I will say it wasn't my favorite either, but I loved the dipping sauce. It  was narrow and had a hard crust, which is for some people (like my roommate), but I prefer softer rolls or at least larger pieces of bread that I can take off the crust. But I was glad I didn't like it because I saved room for dinner!

It was a great North End experience. Great food and ambiance. I look forward to trying other restaurants there, but this was a great place.",1
"1644",5,"I absolutely LOVE this place!  I had driven by it for months before finally search for it online.  This was back before they had a website, so I eventually just called and asked what all they had.  The owner was insanely nice and told me everything they offered and took my order over the phone.  It is now a weekly stop for lunch.  Also, Im not a big soup fan, but Every one of her soups that Ive tried are insanely good!  I am extremely impressed with this place, their service and quality.  Good food, great prices and its local.  What more could you want?",1
"1645",4,"I have been waiting a while to try this joint.  It is right up my alley.  Old family owned business that has not remodeled the interior and has all of that old character.  

Let's start, I sat at the bar and immediately ordered a mixed drink and a skewer of steak tips.  The steak tips were great and were cooked perfectly over charcoal.  Better meat then I really expected, very tender.  The starters were topped off with the wonderful whole hot peppers and hard Italian bread.  

Ordered a simple pepperoni and hot pepper pizza.  It was cooked well done, which I like and the pizza was great.  Once again served with more whole hot peppers.  

The service was very friendly and the food was great.  The lady behind the bar made me feel like I've been going there for 20 years.  

If your in East Boston, I definitely recommend this place.  If you like old school places this is a winner.  

Don't forget to order the steak tips.  

Thanks",1

"1647",4,"At this point, most stuff I review is because I am gluten and dairy intolerant, so I review in that spirit!

I went here last weekend and I'm an out-of-towner so not going to go very often, but I was quite pleased with it from an allergy stand-point. The woman who took my order knew about gluten and made sure that she put that I had the dietary restriction on my order. I ordered the pad thai as that seemed to be gluten and dairy free. Unfortunately their chicken and beef seem to have gluten in it, but the tofu and shrimp are safe. Someone from the kitchen caught that I had ordered chicken that has gluten, and so I was saved! They have a booklet that covers all the allergies, shellfish, peanuts, dairy, etc., and can show it to you. Just beware of the chicken or beef and enjoy! It was affordable and tasty I thought! My friend got a tomato salad and enjoyed that as well! Thanks!!",1

"1650",4,"We ordered to two large meals, a beer, and a really good Cuban coffee for under $20. You can't really beat that!

We ordered the Cuban, which is by far one of the best Cuban sandwiches we have ever eaten. The pork was tender with the perfect amount of seasoning and it perfectly complemented the ham on really good chewy French roll. The rice and black beans had a lot of flavor as well without tasting like it was loaded with salt. 

My jerk chicken salad was also really good. The chicken was moist and loaded with flavor. The greens weren't just iceberg lettuce either.

We ordered a Cuban coffee for dessert and it was a really good espresso just slightly sweetened. Perfect way to end our meal.

The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because I think it's difficult to get a really good vegetarian meal here. I tend to like having the option available even though I'm not strictly vegetarian. This place is definitely a great place to eat if you enjoy meaty dishes.",1

I will def be back for any waxing service in the future!",1
"1652",4,"Awesome crepes place, it's good and it's cheap.  Not to mention that it came with ice cream as well.  Compared to most places in Seattle which charge you $6-7 dollars for just a banana and nutella crepe, this place is a steal.  It's a little hidden though, we drove past it and had to come back around.",1
"1653",5,"Absolutely delicious -- I recommend the tuna tartare, lobster tacos, and chop salad. For entrees, we had the sea bass and filet mignon (both were specials, not on the menu) and they were amazing! The service was spectacular",1
"1654",4,"Good place for a fast, hearty Chicago-inspired sandwich.  The gyros here are very good: flavorful meat with fresh veg and tzatziki sauce.  Feta is extra.  My favorite gyro here is the Feta-Fire: a gyro with the meat and veg tossed in very spicy feta spread.  All are served on nicely grilled pita bread.  Also good is the Italian Beef sandwich: sliced roast beef with Giardenara relish on top, on a hoagie bun.  Thank you, Loops, for serving the juice on the side.  Some other places dump it on the sandwich, turning the bun into a soggy mess.  I like to be able to administer the juice on an as-needed basis.  They also have Chicago style hot dogs, which I have not yet sampled.  I am not a huge fan of their fries, which are very greasy and salty, but some people seem to absolutely love them, so it seems to be a matter of personal preference.  Look for their coupons in the local mailers.  There's usually a good one every month that will save you a couple of bucks if you are getting more than one sandwich.  I like this place for carry out.  It's minutes from my home and they crank out your order in about ten minutes.  I have always found the staff to be friendly and attentive.",1
"1655",5,"Omg just fell in love with this place !!! Did cryo and compression oxygen going on to infra red. My sore shoulder got an instant boost.",1

Here's how I do it:  Call your order in ahead of time.  The menu is on the link at the top of this page.  Just do that.  Then you can show up in about 20 minutes and enjoy the deliciousness.  

That simple.  Call ahead.  Oh, and bring cash, because that is all they take.

As to the food--it is fantastic.  Not just some lame imitation, but truly delicious food.  I have also found the staff to be very friendly and polite, which gets more and more rare these days.  

Will certainly be loyal to this place for the foreseeable future.",1
"1657",5,"So glad I found this place! I try to go Monday- Wednesday and get the deluxe pedicure special where you get a manicure for free. The hot stone foot/leg massage that they do is so amazing, so I like to stop by after work. They even include a short shoulder rub as you are drying. Someone commented that they don't have that harsh acrylic smell when you walk in and I would agree! Definitely the best place I've found if you need a little pampering.",1
"1658",4,"It may look like a strip club from the outside (there being no windows and all), but it's not! Inside it's really beautiful and well-lit. The food is solidly good; I've liked everything I've gotten here. They are good at making recommendations if you are a spice wimp, because some things cannot be ""dialed down"" heat-wise. My favorite is their take on Khao Soi, with a braised duck leg and collards.",1

1) The Garlic, pepperonchini, and pepperoni pizza!

The others were a cheese pizza with bell peppers and onions, and chicken broccoli garlic (white pizza). All were good but completely recommend the first!

Can't wait to come back and try their award winning plain cheese!! Apparently it's one of the top 5 pizzas in the nation! I could def see why!!",1

I really love that they make their caramel in-house, which gives their caramel latte super delicious. I mainly just order caramel lattes whenever I stop by, iced or hot.

"1661",4,"I recently took my Pug/Terrier mix Riley to get his nails cut and groomed at this Davenport clinic. Although a little out of my way, I was recommended to Alex, one of the groomers. 

The clinic itself is bright, inviting and almost pediatric looking with a tons of cartoons and a huge fish tank to entertain the waiting room. I had to run some errands so I dropped off RIley early in the day and Alex was kind enough to call me when he was ready. Because I was so far from the clinic, he actually waited for me to arrive way past the closing time. I was very happy with the way they cleaned Riley and would definitely go back even if I have to drive  a little to get there.",1

This place is a cute little Japanese bakery, and they sell things like cheesecakes and breads with chocolate, peanut butter, fruits, and lots of green tea items. I think they also do wedding cakes, as they have some on display. You can buy individual breads for rather cheap and they are always soft and have nice flavor. Sometimes they come in fun shapes like crabs or seashells. The staff is also super friendly and there is an actual food menu but I've never gotten any like lunch food. There is also a sitting area.

The beds are comfortable and they have a great hotel bar/restaurant which is open 24 hours. They have a great courtyard in the back which is nice and private and you can't hear the car noise, which is nice.

I love this bookstore, although my only complaint is that the 'books' section isn't big enough. But, I guess that's what you get whenever you have a bookstore with a college basis - you also get textbooks and Tech gear as half of the store. Since I'm a student of Paul Mitchell and I don't go to Tech, none of the textbooks are of much use to me. I like how there is a small section in the back where I can get things I need for my iPhone and coffee available nearby; it's like you can run a few errands at once while sipping on some delicious nectar of the gods.. at least that's how I think of my coffee :) My favorite part of coming to Barnes & Noble is that none of my other friends are very interested in browsing bookstores, so I can take this time to get away from 'real life' and it's close enough for me to walk without getting lost on the way back to my apartment (which has happened a lot) and without feeling unsafe on my walk to and from. I'd recommend this bookstore to anyone :)",1
"1670",4,"I love the name of this place. I love the atmosphere about 80% of the time (when they're playing amazing music). The other 20% of the time they're playing music that's a bit too ""specialized"" (loud, punk) for, say, a regular weekday morning.

GREAT fried egg sandwiches with great names and ideas. 

FANTASTIC/BESTEST coffee.

Meh cocktails.

Excellent pie.

Overall a delightfully random experience of offerings and experiences.",1
"1671",4,"Acquired by the very friendly and helpful new owner Tamie in May 2014, Med-Physique at 3 Graces now offers several new spa services, including Exlis, Botox, Juvederm, specialized peels, laser hair removal...as well as a variety of message styles to choose from and organic airbrush spray tanning...all in the newly remodeled spa facility. 

Although I loved my services provided at 3 Graces before, the space was indeed in need of a bit of a ""makeover"" itself. Great new facility and treatment options; however, I only visit for message or spray tans so I can't speak to quality of other services.",1
"1672",4,"My Husband and I showed up at 8:50 AM because I read there would be a line and wait for tacos. It was deserted and they were loading their truck from the grocery store. We felt bad for showing up so early but they didn't tell us to leave or anything so we read the menu till they finished unloading their groceries. The man and women on the truck weren't super friendly but they were not rude either just kinda mellow. The food was really good it had a lot of flavor. Honestly too much flavor, my taco was so spicy I got an upset stomach! We got the queso and chips which was really good texture wise, it tasted like sweet melted chorizo.",1
"1673",4,"Had been dying to come here for the longest time, drove by probably a million times and was always super curious about it. Recently i finally made it in and wasn't disappointed at all. I think my favorite thing about the restaurant is the decor/ambience. It is very quirky and cute and kind of reminds me of a three way cross between a hipster/dive bar, an upscale fancy restaurant and snow white's House. Honestly I'm not sure how to describe it or if that makes sense, but i loved it. The food was pretty good, big portions of Italian classics, fairly reasonably priced. I don't recommend the sangria.",1

"1675",5,"Having been raised in the woods of NH where I'd grown up with our family's auto repair shop and knew only of trustworthy mechanics with a smile, I've been on the search for a place near the city with similar qualities since I moved down here 10+ years ago.  Well, the search is over... Look no further than George and his shop at Alewife Auto!  He's one of those guys that calls you back immediately (even if YOU accidentally lose the connection, HE'S the one that calls back to make sure YOU'RE alright!), he took a look at my car upon tow-truck arrival despite being outside their repair hours, and he had it quickly fixed and ready to roll for me by Monday morning.  The most amazing part about all of this is that he found the problem to be such a minor ""thing"" that he did not charge me... I almost cried!  Being a severely underpaid teacher I had been trying to work out which of my other bills would have to be skipped in order to pay this repair bill, but instead it turned out to truly be my St. Patrick's Day luck of the Irish and I will only bring my car here from now on!  Thank you George and Alewife Auto!  I promised you cookies and they'll be coming soon!",1
"1676",4,"I have been waiting months to try this place and finally did last night!  

Love the low lit ambience and wooden walls. Place looked busy, but we were seated right away! 

We had a bottle of the lambruscu, a special of the evening- mozzarella and mushroom risotto balls, the georgia bibb salad, spicy pork pizza, and the apple pie special of the dessert.

Everything was amazing and tasty! The risotto was our fave and I hope they make it a regular on the menu. 

Can't wait to go back and try more pizzas and specials!",1

"1678",4,"Yum yum yum! I ate here last night with my partner and had an overall enjoyable dining experience. There are several things worth noting:

1. The way the space is set up is very serene. It definitely made me feel more relaxed.
2. The food is delicious. Having never been here before, partner and I tried an appetizer, a bread dish, and split a main course. I'm vegan, so everything is with that slant, but I really enjoyed everything I ate. It was all really tasty. 
3. The bathroom is a little weird (but not in a gross way, just in a weird way)

Otherwise, there isn't much to say. Service was very friendly and knew about veganism, the place was busy, but I could still hold my conversation, and we were in and out of there in about an hour and 15 minutes. Not bad, Rangzen, not bad. Cool Peace for Tibet poster, too.",1

The library/museum is easily accessible by public transit (Red Line T stop and free shuttle bus) or by car (free parking lot). Carve out a couple of hours...This library/museum is a historical treasure and has mass appeal. It was encouraging to see the Young Adult aka ""YA"" demographic  - the same demographic that considers Twilight, The Hunger Games, and 50 Shades of Grey as literature masterpieces - patiently combing through the library/museum. There is still hope for Millennials...

I am far from a history buff, but this place is filled with neat historical factoids and detailed historical context, and was a stark reminder of how I've become overly-dependent on unreliable sources of information like Wikipedia.

Be sure to check out the Ernest Hemingway exhibit as well...",1
"1680",5,"FYI: This review is in regards to colon hydrotherapy only. I haven't used any of their other services.

I love this place! Tasha is the sweetest lady and is very warm and welcoming. I first came here over a year ago when I purchased a Groupon package. This was before they moved to their new (current) location. The old location only had one hydrotherapy machine and it was located inside a salon. Her current location has 2 machines and a lot more space. The location is very clean and professional as well as the staff.

The only complaint I have ever had about this place is their online schedule is a bit frustrating because it's always booked out months in advance so if you want an appointment in the near future you pretty much have to call Tasha to get in. However, she is fairly quick to return calls so you will be able to get in but you need some patience. I'm sure with cancellations and walk-ins it's very difficult to keep the schedule current on a day-to-day basis. So, that being said, be prepared to call for an appointment in the near future if you don't want to have to book out as far as a month (+) or so in advance. Also, they do give you a reminder phone call the day before your appointment and you get an email reminder via the online booking generator on their website if you booked through the site (I'm not sure if you get an email when you book via phone).

Note: I've not been to any other businesses for colonics because I really like this place, the service, and the staff. It was my first and I'm sticking with them. Highly recommended!",1

Several items ordered and all were delivered exactly as requested.  Waiter was very friendly and professional.  Would highly recommend this restaurant in the quaint village of Celebration.",1
"1682",4,"We were so pleased with our meal here! Everything is delicious - great oyster selection, the mussels appetizer was in an incredible, tasty sauce...Our entrees were all fantastic - most notably the halibut dish, in which the chef turns a normally boring fish into a tantalizing and exotic entree that I'm dying to have again! The king crab special was also incredible. Atmosphere is small, cozy, casual. We thought prices were reasonable given the location and quality. Would definitely return. Not a great place for a large group (its small and tables are tight) but perfect for date night or dinner with a smaller group.",1

Their menu is well-curated, everything is cooked to order. Expect a bit of a wait, but that wait will be worth it. 

Get the garlic noodles: they will change your life.",1
"1685",4,"A far superior experience here as opposed to their Highlands location.
Of course any range of taco's are amazing, but we find their fish tacos and their ""bowls"" to be the most consistent dishes.  It's a bit challenging at time to park, even with Valet assistance give where it is located close to an intersection and on a very busy Marietta Street.  We have actually found that parking on the street within a few blocks is more convenient and available. 
In our most recent visit our server Sunny was absolutely amazing - it's worth asking for her section if you may have to grab a drink and wait for one of her table's to open up.",1

They also infuse their own vodkas so my non-teatotalling friends love to drink while digging into the goodies on their plates.

Everything I've had is good and the service is warm and friendly.

My professional, Maggie K. arrived 10 minutes before her scheduled time.  She was pleasant and got right to work.  I have a lot of wood furniture and a lot of glass and my apartment gets very dusty.  She did a great job dusting and cleaning all the glass.  The bathroom sparkled and the kitchen counters, floors, etc were nice and clean.
The oven, however was not done well, but then it had been a while since I cleaned it.
The only other complaint was that she borrowed my mop but did not rinse it clean before putting it back in the utility closet.

Maybe the fact that I was as home and supervising was the difference but I would use her again but on an as needed basis not recurring.",1

"1692",5,"This meal was fabulous! Corey was awesome directing us through the menu making awesome suggestions! We brought wine and ordered some Greek wine as well. The dips were great so was the saginaki cheese, octopus, but the lamb pie was flipping amazing! So was the fish! And the desserts were awesome!",1

I ended my meal with milk chocolate schmeer covered with potato chips, dark chocolate crumbs, and a scoop of cookie dough ice cream that had a round cookie inside. Heaven.

Service was excellent and the entire restaurant is laid out nicely.  The only thing I would suggest is that they have a larger identifying sign out front.  That may be by choice, but it was hell finding this place.  Of the 8 people, 5 people had to call and have one of us go out on the sidewalk to flag them down and identify the location.",1
"1694",5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this hotel.  I come to Orlando a couple times a year for business and this is by far the best hotel in the Disney area I've stayed at.   The hotel itself is beautiful.  The rooms are stunning and the lobby bar is cozy and the wait staff is SUPER competent and friendly.   Also, I have to say they have the NICEST and fastest valet service I've experienced in a long time.   

I was also impressed with the workout area that looked like a REAL high-end gym and I really like the understated pool area that had Brown Jordan lounge chairs.  When you enter the pool area, and attendant follows you to the area you want to sit and sets everything up for you!   I also found the waiters at the pool bar/cafe very friendly.  The drinks and food were great and very reasonably priced.

Lastly, the first night I had dinner with a colleague at the lobby bar and the food was great -- and very reasonably priced for the quality.

Whoever is the GM of this hotel is doing their job -- this is a very well run hotel and I WILL be back.",1

They also have a self-checkout station if you prefer that. It's definitely a smaller branch, but I put holds online and APL sends the book I want to them, where I pick it up. I'm excited about the renovations and I hope they'll take advantage of the beautiful surroundings by putting in lots of windows!",1

"1697",4,"Located in the heart of Buckhead, The Capital Grill is great place to celebrate special occasion. As for me, I was celebrating anniversary with my wife.  
They do offer valet parking, but if you park your self in the shopping vicinity of the area they do not offer voucher.  So if you are shopping at jimmy choo or other retail stores make sure to get a parking voucher from them.
Our server was very attentive and checked on us often.. We ordered French onion soup, Fried calamari, African lobster tail, and Porcini rubbed Delmonico steak with 12yr aged balsamic, and lobster Mac n cheese to share.
French onion soup was so good, and fried calamari had a little kick with jalape├▒os but spicy in a good way. Our main entree which we shared lobster and steak along with lobster Mac n cheese was very good.. Lobster was broiled and cook to perfection and lobster Mac n cheese was also delicious.. Although I enjoyed my steak my wife thought steak was little too greasy and needed a sauce, but I like the New York style with taste of porcini mushroom with aged balsamic.. I could eat that all day.. Portion was very generous and it was impossible to finish everything on the table.
At the end they also brought out the desert for our anniversary.",1

Prices were as expected (~$15 per entree). We ordered the eggplant chicken, lamb korma, and the pistachio coconut naan. All three were delicious. The lamb korma was the best of the bunch for me - fantastic! Be aware that the naan is sweet rather than savory

The portion sizes were huge - two people could definitely share one entree.",1

Usually this person keeps the place clean and adds a bit of  charm to the service. Everything I have had here has been delicious. They loose a star because the place could use some new ceiling tiles and a coat of fresh paint.",1

The menu doesn't have a large selection, but it's big enough. We had a couple glasses of wine, the hummus plate- best hummus out of a restaurant-, we both ordered the lamb gyro plate, which came with a side salad. OMG. The lamb was cooked to perfection. So tender and they were big ass chunks of lamb meat. The gyro itself was gigantic. It had so much flavor. 

After we ate we had some more wine and just sat and relaxed. The restaurant has a really nice, calming atmosphere. They play good music- not too loud, either. We definitely will be back. Like, ASAP.",1

I came in the Mercedes dealership on the first business day of 2015 to purchase a new CLA250(4Matic) and Georgina patiently spent most of the afternoon with me for test drive, model review and quotes on all available vehicles in inventory across all Herb Chambers dealerships in MA. I was able to have all my questions answered accurately and discussed every possible option with Georgina. 

It was such a pleasant experience that I felt confident enough to secure the deal on my first visit. Georgina managed to get all paperwork done on a last-minute notice and made sure things go smoothly during the logistics and handling processes. She even pre-specified the setting for me before I returned to pick up the new car and went through the whole setting procedure with me. Moreover, prompt follow-up was delivered and she cared for not only my buying experience but also the driving part. 

I really appreciate the time and efforts she took to ensure a successful deal and develop a solid customer relationship. I wish you best of luck in her business and will certainly visit her again when it is a good time for a new car for me and all my friends.",1

We used to make our own chocolate at home from fresh cacao fruit(we had this readily available in Costa Rica) , and because of that experience I believe we probably appreciate the taste more than others might. We notice it more, and to us it tasted terrific.

I got 1 scoop of the Oreo cookie dough and my girlfriend got the confetti cookie dough. We left the cafe, sat on the benches and started nibbling on it. We enjoyed it very much until 5 bites later the sweetness was too much to bare. Too much sugar?! I know. We barely ate it half way. 1 scoop was too much so I'd advice maybe even sharing just one scoop together. We were walking to the trash and realized others felt the same way. Spoons sticking out half a cup of cookie dough in the trash can. Otherwise. It was still fun to try out!",1

The paneer special is very good, but don't miss the buffet - the vegetables are interesting, well seasoned, every time. Attentive service, even with buffet.

I like that the buffet is not overwhelming with too many food options and the food is good. This was my first time trying Tibetan food and I will definitely be going back. The food is not heavy or too spicy and the lentil soup is AMAZING! The service is good and if you are going for the lunch buffet the place fills up quickly.",1

Of course they have gone thru many cooks over the years, but use the same recipes. Shrimp foo young, fried shrimp and egg rolls are a must.  Family favorites are beef broccoli or peapods extra garlic, beef noodles extra gravy, garlic and peapods, cauliflower chicken extra garlic,  mushroom duck and say and air spareribs.  They are not very meaty, but love the brown sauce!  Atmosphere is dingy and sometimes wait staff rude,  but good food if you order right.",1

It was my first time at this location and the woman admitted that they don't have as large of a selection as the Hawthorne location but I still managed to do pretty well. Portobellos, zucchini, mixed grape tomatoes, red pepper, a Vidallia onion and garlic that would all end up on the grill. I was looking for a few other items that they ran out of like squash and they didn't have the variety of mushrooms that the other spot has but everything went over great.

Being that I have friends up in Arbor Lodge now, I'm pretty sure I'll be back here.

"1717",4,"While the House of Blues definitely still has some kinks to work out, I am so excited about the possibilities that this new venue holds. The ghost of Avalon still haunts the space with the same general first floor plan, but it is seriously enhanced. Speakers and equipment aren't in your face, there's more room to wander and mingle, and there's a nice separation between the sunken floor area and the two bars along the sides (for those of us who are semi-claustrophobic and can't stand being crammed against the front of the stage). And the balconies? They rock! The corners of both the second and third floors truly offer the best view in the whole place, so get there early and stake out your spot ASAP. 

My first trip to the newly remodeled HOB was for the Justin Nozuka & Missy Higgins show. The line was semi-confusing (you have to wait for a drinking bracelet, and then wait again to enter the venue). But seriously? It wasn't nearly as annoying as many of my fellow Yelpers seem to think. And I can confirm Hugh R.'s statement that, while the HOB staff seem to be Camera Nazis, it's really easy to sneak in without forking over the $4 to check them. Yes, it's a little violating that they run you over with metal detectors, but all the staff that I encountered at HOB from the ticket attendants to the bartenders were extremely friendly and gracious. I can't wait to go back and see another show!",1

The shop has expanded, and it's now easier to enjoy your burrito inside. Make sure you add some hot sauce.",1

"1726",4,"Great food for an affordable price. The lunch buffet exceeded my expectations by including unlimited garlic and plain naan and veggie samosas in addition to all the other delicious entrees. I'm usually a chicken tikka masala person, but I found myself going for the beef Karahi and tandoori chicken the most. With aromatic and punchy flavors, the beef Karahi was one of my favorite dishes in the buffet. 

For $8.95, this place had a great selection and good quality Indian cuisine. Definitely coming back!",1

They have a great and modern feel, with each one unique in it's own way. The staff are good at keeping things clean and in order, even when they are busy and turning tables quickly. They have a nice selection of options and each time I have made a special request, the staff have been very accommodating. I have been on a Prosciutto Pizza kick lately, and I like that you can order the pizzas whole or half, if you aren't hungry enough to finish the whole thing. Then, there is always leftovers.",1

I'm on a gluten free diet, so it's hard for me to find yummy sweets, but their GF donuts are the absolute best! They're small, so you don't feel bad eating more than one (or three!). My fav flavors are cinnamon roll, french toast, chocolate and lemon bar (without the streusel). Be sure to call ahead because they don't have GF donuts every day, but will happily make you some, if you give them a days notice. And, as a tea drinker, they have a really great selection of hot teas, which I appreciate. I highly recommend Da Vinci's Dunwoody!",1

Gluten free bakery is available, though shipped in from another company.",1
"1732",5,"We happened upon this place one Saturday morning while trying to find a nearby nail salon. What a great surprise!  Food is plentiful, fresh (prepared in front of your eyes), and very tasty. It may seem a bit pricey, but you get a huge serving. I took home half of my crepe and enjoyed it for supper. 
The staff is very friendly and efficient. If I gave one constructive criticism, it's that if you are shorter than 5'6"", you will have the glass partition between you and those preparing your crepe and it's difficult to hear them. 
I will go back again and again. A perfect brunch place or any meal for that matter.",1
"1733",5,"Excuse my snapchat photo but I just couldn't wait to dig in! 

The One Sushi just started doing their ramen pop up for brunch (Saturday- Sunday from 12:00- 2:00 pm) and I had to come. Bonus points because it is down the street from me! I've tried many different ramen places around Atlanta but this one def takes the cake!",1
"1734",5,"We decided last minute to splurge Saturday night. We wanted to try a place that we had never been to before. We had meaning for years to try Cameron's American Bistro, it is the original, where it all began for the famous Cameron Mitchell's restaurants. We did not have reservations. We hoped that they had a bar. When we arrived the hostess greeted us pleasantly and she said that they have full service at their bar. It is inviting and modern. The restaurant is quaint, and beautiful inside. We explained to our bartender that this was our very first visit and she made us feel extremely welcomed. We started with the cocktail shrimp which tasted perfect. Hot bread with a whole roast garlic was also served. Our bartender explained that you spread the garlic on the bread and it was amazing. I had never had roasted garlic like that before and I can't wait to impress my friends and do it at home. My main dish was the teriyaki salmon and it was cooked to absolute perfection. It made my mouth so happy. We both agreed that after this wonderful dinner and experience we can't wait to get back to Cameron's for a truly amazing evening.",1
"1735",4,"I came in a little skeptical because was pleasantly surprised about how good it was! My family had the turmeric fish banh mi, pork belly banh mi, and grilled chicken confit rice bowl and we loved everything! The banh mi had fresh ingredients and comes with tater tots. The rice plates had a delicious ginger rice and tasty roasted vegetables. I would definitely come back again! I would've given this place 5 stars as I really loved the food, but I had to take away a star for not being family friendly - they didn't have a changing table in their bathrooms, which makes it difficult for families with babies.",1
"1736",4,"Coffee is superb! Lots of spaces to sit and do work. Definitely seemed understaffed though, lots of people waiting for drinks and only one person making them. Would come back!",1
"1737",5,"Warning!! Not your average Pho place!! I was shocked to find different specials for each day of the week, which made feel weird at first only because of other Pho places having such a variety and different choices. I chose the chicken soup with egg and was really impressed! Not too salty and different veggies were used which made for a nice change. I showed up at 10:30am and half the restaurant was full!! I will be back!!",1
"1738",4,"Food:  great place to grab some Swedish meatballs and shop at the same time.   Food is tasty and healthy options are available, and the price can't be beat!   Very reasonable.  The coffee machine alone is worth the trip.  Cost for all you can drink coffee is $1... free if you have a family membership card. Each cup is ground on demand and you can get espresso, Americano, cappuccino, or a latte. Unbelievable! 

Products:  too many to list.  This store has everything for your home including food, and prices are all reasonable, including many that seem almost too cheap. 

Entertainment value:  worth a trip just to see it!",1
"1739",5,"I have eaten here TWICE in the past week because there were so many things on the menu that I wanted to try. All of the cocktails were delicious, and the food (appetizers, sides and entrees) was incredible. The ambiance and heated patio make for a great dining experience. This is hands down my new favorite restaurant in VaHi!",1
"1740",4,"I have heard nothing but good things about The Walrus since its opening, which isn't surprising given their connection to The Tavern. We gave it a couple of weeks, then walked over for a Friday happy hour. The setup is very cool - lots of outdoorsy space, with the front of the restaurant completely open to the sidewalk, so you could sit out or just inside and get some (fresh?) air. If you prefer something different, request a seat in the back, past the service station and closer to the bar. There, it is air-conditioned and dark.

First off, happy hour. Cheap, good, and did I mention cheap? $2 to $2.50 for craft beers, that's my kind of place before 6. This week's tap takeover was Four String, but there were plenty of other options. We ordered the bacon-wrapped, deep-fried deviled eggs. A side of horseradish and a requested side of sriracha = OM NOM NOM. The spouse ordered the short rib dinner, which came with a lovely side of roasted carrots and parsnips. I took on the bahn mi sandwich and fries. I think they were going for the foie gras texture by having only marinated tofu on the bahn mi, but ultimately it ended up tasting more grainy and sour than smooth/creamy. Fresh cilantro and a longer grill time for the tofu would help get those texture issues resolved. The spouse pronounced the short rib ""decent,"" but thoroughly enjoyed the carrots and parsnips.

Overall, we were impressed with the space, the specials, the service and the manager stopping by our table during the meal. We left nodding and talking about when we could come back and who we'd bring along. Great first-time visit and it won't be our last.",1
"1741",5,"Wow!  They have the most amazing drink menu.  If anything, try Zen on Ten just to mix up your usual Happy Hour.  The bar area is just gorgeous.  I went here for my birthday with about 15 people unexpectedly and we were handled beautifully by the accomodating and flexible staff.  I had a big blue alcoholic fishbowl called a Volcano Blast for my first bday drink followed by some other rummy and colorful concoctions.  I enjoyed 2 sushi rolls that were a cut above typical sushi rolls and I also tried my friend's panang curry. Panang can be very bland, but this panang curry had fabulous deep flavor, pizazz, and a nice kick.   Parking is a breeze at the Tivoli Tenside building, so no valet or street parking drama. We enjoyed a trio of acoustic musicians on Friday night.  The ambiance is very urban and sexy yet cozy.  I will be coming here a lot more.  The owner is a delight.  He greets you and makes sure that everyone is smiling!  My friends really liked it as well.  It was their first time here.  I will be back for those amazing blue drinks and some sushi very soon.",1
"1742",5,"Been here twice, both excellent experiences. We had the spicy chipotle calamari, seared ahi tuna and spicy shrimp as appetizers. Each one was outstanding in flavor (and I don't even like calamari). On our first visit, we shared the carne gordo, a steak that was cooked to perfection and with amazing flavors. On our second visit, we ordered the kobe steak prepared as the evening's special and again enjoyed every bite of a perfectly cooked steak with flavors to match. We ended the evening with the oba Argentina dessert. Chocolate cake layered with bananas, vanilla bean ice cream, light cream (caramelized exquisitely) surrounded by guavas and other fruits made this dessert one of a kind!",1
"1743",5,"I was happy to see one coming to the neighborhood since I did like the one by my old house. They are super nice and helpful here. My wings are always piping hot and tasty! The fries were cold the first time I ordered here,this time they were hot, but I forgot to ask them to hold the sugar sprinkle. I don't like sweet fries! The hickory bbq wings are my favorite, My bf likes the mild. I tried the garlic Parmesan this time they were nothing to write home about.",1
"1744",4,"Not the best breakfast taco I've ever had in my life but it definitely did the job. We had a big order and they got everything just right which was good! The prices are also very reasonable and there was plenty of parking!",1
"1745",5,"Had heard/read mixed reviews but can tell you we had a wonderful experience. Sat at the bar on a Friday night; Jenn was our bartender. She was busy but very attentive. We started with New England Clam Chowder- awesome. Jenn recommended the Crab Cake dinner which I ordered and my husband had the spaghetti (he loves pasta!) the crab cake was the best I've had in a very long time. I chose a salad and rice as my sides and was pleased with both too. My husband's spaghetti sauce had plenty of meat in it and was a large portion. The only downside to it for me was it tasted too much like tomatoes instead of spaghetti sauce but my husband said it was good. We will be making this a regular dinner spot. BTW happy hour everyday 11-6.",1
"1746",5,"First time here and I was impressed. Friendly staffs and quality drinks. Had tiramisu milk tea and I loved it. Will come back in the future.",1
"1747",5,"If you want old fashioned customer service this is your place!  From the girls in front to the staff out back.  Your investment in tile and countertops are in great hands.",1
"1748",5,"As a European, I know what is good Italian and what is bad Italian food. I'll tell you that the food here literally gave me a taste of home and perfection! Most amazing stuff and wine list. Everything was on it highest!",1
"1749",5,"The train stopped us from going to breakfast at another place so we decided to Yelp a few places when this one came up.Im surprised there wasn't a line as when we came in as we we're seated right away. 

Had a manmosa and one of the daily special pancakes that came with chorizo which was very yummy. The German pancakes here are super fluffy and crispy. Definitely check out the specials on your way in.",1
"1750",4,"My question to management: My family & I went 6/20/16, we noticed that the All you can eat Rock Shrimp was no longer on the menu. Very disappointing. Is this temporary or permanent?",1
"1751",4,"This is a favorite place of mine and my choir colleagues. As we sing at a church not far from here, it's a nice easy walk for a fun night. 

The food is good, and I've never had a bad meal here. But to me (and the rest of my friends), the real star are the margaritas. The horni margarita is delicious!! We always get pitchers of this and dig into the nachos. 

I have nothing but good things to say about this place. Definitely make sure to go and enjoy a drink!",1
"1752",4,"YUM! Tasty food, good service, and decent prices!

I always leave this place feeling full and satisfied. I have tried their yellow curry with the pineapple which was rich in flavor (though the chicken in the dish was a bit dry), the rad nar is great and definitely filling, and their fried duck with the spicy mayo dish surprised me in terms of it actually tasting good; but their standout dish in my opinion is their tom kha soup, which is a version of the tom yum soup except this one has a coconut milk base.

Definitely will frequent this place more often to satisfy my Thai food cravings whenever I am in Quincy!",1
"1753",4,"Their Dim Sum was great! Very tasty! The chef even came and check on us to make sure we are satisfied and he even gave us egg tarts on the house to try. One of the best egg tarts I ever had! But the service was not so great.. But they just opened and the server was new. I would come back here for dim sum and will be trying their dinner menu soon.",1
"1754",4,"Beer was ok. Only tried the couch and Lou a cult both were decent. The steak nacho were really good though small. Good enough for an appetizer though for 2",1
"1755",4,"i really wish that i live closer to el chilito. i really miss this place, as it was a staple of my saturday post downtown hangover experience.

their coffee is extremely good - very rich and something about it tastes really smokey and delicious. their ham, potato and cheese breakfast tacos are phenom.  both the ham and potatoes are CUBED perfectly allowing maximum surface area.

the only thing i want to complain about is the sheer number of entry-level alts that frequent this place.  their mirrored sunglasses are an affront to the human race. there also seem to be a lot of GRAD students who sit at the tables on the patio talking about important ""issues"" at a very loud volume when it is crowded and there is limited space.  these people need to leave and go to kirby lane where they belong - a place that is marginally alt but still mainstream enough to have more than 2 locations in austin.

in addition, at el chilito you can find a number of ""hip families"" from the east side getting breakfast/brunch.  some of the children there make me feel insecure about myself because they are drinking earth friendly drinks like horchata or something - which is definitely more than i can pull off.

i'd say that if you are extremely confident about your hipness and you enjoy geometrically-shaped taco contents, you will not be disappointed by el chilito.",1
"1756",5,"A radiant review for Lisa's part in my glowing complexion!  As a performer, stage make-up is my skin's mortal enemy.  I did extensive research on facialists and spas in the city.  I decided on Lisa because she was in the neighborhood and her prices were very competitive.  I had my first facial with her yesterday and she was wonderful; very sweet and attentive and the lady knows what she's doing.  Your skin will absolutely be in good hands and you will leave feeling refreshed and totally relaxed.

Thank you Lisa!",1
"1757",4,"The food is decent, the old man at the counter is amazing. 4 stars for great fast service, he was super nice, and always smiled. I wouldn't say I was thrilled with the food,but overall, I like good service, and that's what I'm rating.",1
"1758",5,"I have been going to Paris Nail on and off for years and steady again for the last year.  They have consistently been a great place even with staff changes.  I love all of the current employees.  I get the best manicure and pedicures I have experienced for a great price (they rival ones you get at a place like the Away Spa at the W Hotel).",1
"1759",5,"Wow! Wow! Wow! My house looks amazing!! These women don't mess around. They get in there and pull up dirt you didn't even know you had from every nook and cranny! My house sparkles . Like, you can literally see your own reflection on the hardwood floors! Casey and Cassy (I know, cute, right?) were super friendly, conscientious, and efficient. They arrived on time (which if you've ever had house cleaners, you know this is a rare occurrence) did a complete walk thru of the house and asked about my priorities and expectations. And their execution was flawless. They were very thorough and every surface shines. 

- Scheduling - was a breeze! They were so accommodating and prompt.
- Timeliness - they were on time, eager and ready to tackle the house immediately upon arrival.
- Communication - they were excellent communicators making sure to understand my expectations.
- Meticulous - if there's someone you want to be meticulous, it's definitely your cleaner. They didn't miss a single surface or spot. 
- Efficient - they were thorough AND fast! 
- Service - they were super friendly and trustworthy


I'm so happy to have a clean house that's ready to rent out. In fact, I'm having second thoughts about renting such a clean house to random renters and am tempted to move back in myself!!! My friend happened to stop by right after they had finished and commented that our renters were getting the cleanest house in Portland :)! So happy with Maid for Portland. Thank youuuuuuuuu!",1
"1760",5,"Despite the restaurant bringing us the wrong food and having to wait for them to cook new dishes, I still would rate it five stars!! They don't give you masses of meat for the price, so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're looking to pig out. However, the food is just SOO tasty that you wouldn't complain! I highly recommend the chicken korma and cheese naan, which tastes just like a naan quesadilla *heavenly*!! The service is great and the manager basically gave us our meal free for the wait. 

I have been to this restaurant plenty of times and will continue to come despite the food mistakes tonight!",1
"1761",5,"Totally worth the type! On a road trip through PNW and had to stop here. Rosemary Raspberry buttermilk donut is truly unique and delicious! Coffee is great too!",1
"1762",5,"For the money it's a great place.  Super clean and the transportation to the attractions are great.",1
"1763",5,"It's was my first time , I got a amazing massage ever . I feel more energy inside my body than before. Great price for a massage place.",1
"1764",5,"This place is my favorite place for vegan cuisine. The service is amazing, the food is fairly priced, lots of options to choose from. My wife and I took our hardcore carnivore family here without telling them it was plant-based and they couldn't tell the difference! They still talk about how good it was months after eating here. The sweet older gentleman that waits on us  every time is a gem too!",1
"1765",5,"Went here last night for dinner and was impressed! Delicious upscale Thai food with local twists - highly recommended for anyone wanting a special meal in kits. The appies and entrees were reasonably priced ($11-$22 ish) but the wine and beers were very expensive for the area - min $7 for a cheap Thai beer and $15 minimum for a glass of wine) but the food and atmosphere were so good. I have a peanut allergy so you would think this place would NOT be able to accommodate that but they did with no issues!!! There was only 2 dishes on the menu that were made with peanuts (in the sauce) and the rest could be substituted with cashews or nothing at all. 

Standout dish: the chicken cashew (entre) and the Brussels sprouts (appetizer). Sooo good considering Vancouver is famous for having crispy Brussels sprouts on every restaurant menu- I can honestly say these were the best I have had in Vancouver. So good as they use almonds and fish sauce in them! Yum 

We will definitely be back!!",1
"1766",5,"My friend has been preaching to me about this place for years now. (The original one that is) This place absolutely lived up to the height. The brisket I had was just absolutely insane. I've never had such moist, tender, flavorful meat before. The char was perfect, the smoke ring was perfect, the seasoning was top. And the banana pudding is to die for. Absolutely come here if you find yourself in Austin.",1
"1767",5,"Enjoyed the fried chicken and sides. Chicken had a little kick but was lightly battered and the sides were delicious, would definitely go back.",1
"1768",5,"Bombbbbbbbbb food!!! Omg everything !!! And super cheap. It's unbelievably delicious and fresh all raw and cooked. All veggies too. High quality",1
"1769",5,"Had an amazing meal.  Started with the mozarella, tomato, basil salad that was simple but perfect!  Went on to a porcini rubbed delmonico that was perfectly cooked with amazing flavors.  The service was friendly and on top of things.",1
"1770",4,"I've been to a couple of Home Depots and such.

Lowe's by far has the friendliest and most helpful employees. Yay!

This is where I buy all my house handy-woman stuff.",1
"1771",5,"Bang Tidy is Portland at its best: down to earth, eclectic, independently owned and operated boutique hair salon.  Bianca has been doing my hair for nearly ten years.  I've seen a lot of stylists in my day and the truth of the matter is that many make that hour or more of my life a dreary hell.  

No.  I don't want to talk about shopping.  No.  I don't want to talk about television shows.  And that might just be my personal preference but the great thing about Bianca is that she is smart, non-judgmental and has something interesting to say about anything.  Everyone I know who has come her way says she makes them feel relaxed and they enjoy chatting with her.  

Bianca is also a stylist who will do your hair the way you want it.  I find it works best when I have some pictures or a specific person in mind that she can reference (The Patti Smith look was my personal favorite for a while) even for touch ups.  Her cuts also grow out well (which is a double edged sword for Bianca because it means I probably frequent her salon less than I should).

And as a plus did I mention you can book your appointments online?!?!?!?  So easy.",1
"1772",4,"I will become a regular here! 

The food was very, very good (I had a chicken/prosciutto dish, and my friends had lobster ravioli, mushroom ravioli and veal braciole).  

The wait staff and service were outstanding!  They, along with the owner who is a vibrant life-long resident of the North End, made me feel like I was sitting at a friend's having dinner... this unpretentious family owned and operated little place was exactly what the doctor ordered - I couldn't have asked for a better overall experience.

I would love to see the wine selection and the dessert options expand, but what they do have paired nicely with our dinners - two of us shared the only Montepulciano on the menu and the other two of us shared one of the Chardonnays, for dessert - a cannoli, oh yeah, and Sambuca :)",1
"1773",5,"I was very surprised that this Vietnamese restaurant would actually be good. I walked in thinking it would be mediocre. I have had food from the TO GO side and the sit down restaurant side. On the sit down side you order first before you sit down and refills are $1. There is a small main dining room area and a down stairs dining area. I've had
Bo luc lac (shaking beef), Bun thit nuong (vermicelli and pork), egg rolls, and pho ga (chicken pho). All were really good and I could tell it was authentic. The first meal I had here was the pho ga and I could tell from there that this place is legit. The pho had perfect bold authentic flavor. If you are in the down town area and want real Vietnamese food this is the spot.",1
"1774",4,"Great little spot in Richmond.  Open late, great tea and dessert and wonderful ambiance and decor.  

Exactly what I was looking for.",1
"1775",5,"I guess nobody has reviewed this place before because Acton is kind of in the middle of nowhere. I wish there was a campus closer to Boston so I could go all the time. But that's fine... the less people who know about it, the easier it is for me to make an appointment :)

I just came back from my massage about 2 hours ago and feel wonderful. 

The Massage School offers a $25 massage ""clinic."" It's the only massage they offer. It is wonderful. A FULL hour, whole body neck to toes, choose your pressure level. It is so cheap for an absolutely glorious massage.",1
"1776",4,"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, this is probably not your place.

With that said, regardless of the lack of authenticity, the food was pretty good. I had the Grilled Chicken Torta with fries and thought the grilled chicken was perfectly well done- not too dry like it usually is- and the sauce-cheese combination was perfect. The fries were also very tasty, but by the time I was finished with the Torta and complimentary chips/salsa, i couldn't get through even half of them.",1
"1777",4,"We vacation to this area a couple of times a year and it has become a tradition for us to eat here the first night in town.

The food is typical hibachi style food that can be found anywhere in the country. We have found the service to be very good and food plentiful. Only place we have ever had potatoes as part of a hibachi meal but whatever. 

Maybe the 4 stars are weighed more by sentiment but we will still be going there and you should try it too",1
"1778",4,"I will not give 5 stars YET b/c I have yet to try every single burger on the menu, but so far I'm so hooked. I'm not one of red meat usually, but when I get a hankering for a burger, Hopdoddy is what pops in my head. Can you say NOM NOM?!  Oh and the beers are massive. Don't have to worry about where to sit b/c they save seats for you while you're in line. You get your burger cooked the way you want. It's such a great concept, specialty burgers. Perfect location as well. Don't worry about parking... Park in the free parking lot in the back. 

I just can't frequent this place too much or I'll gain weight!! Being a health conscious Austinite, I try to find healthier alternatives to age old favorites like the classic burger. Hopdoddy has fresh local ingredients and uses quality beef. That makes me feel a lot better about what I'm eating.",1

"1781",5,"This is my first escape room 'review', but my third time doing an escape room.  I thought it would be better to experience a few before writing a review...

I have done: Combo & Key's, ""Case of the Missing O.D.""; Portland Escape Room's, ""Kidnapped""; and now Escapism's, ""Jungle Ransom"".  I have thoroughly enjoyed each, but must say Jungle Ransom is my favorite.  I should add, my family and I have been successful at all three, but were given a few extra minutes with our first escape room.  (I blame the two random guys who joined us, but that is another story...)

Our Jungle Ransom host, Mythius (pronounced Mah-Thy-Us), was awesome!  As soon as we arrived, he was in full character!  It caught me off guard as I expected to go through some formalities before beginning.  Mythius (his real name, can't recall his character's name) explained the scenario, let us know what was expected of us, and set us on our way!  This was the first escape room where the host was not in the room with us.  Looking back, being the only ones in the room, added to my family's experience.  Mythius was a walkie talkie away if we needed hints.  Of course with my pride, asking for a hint was out of the question...  We did ask for a time check part way through the escape.

After a quick info session, we were escorted to the room and left to figure out what to do...

I can't say much else other than we benefited from good communication and people who think very differently.  I guess that's no help...  I will say Mythius added to this escape room experience and his efforts made this a 5-star review for my family and I.  Enjoy!",1
"1782",5,"Always consistently good donairs. I get the same thing every time beef and chicken mixed donair and it always hits the spot. Nothing amazing but if you are hungry and looking for a good affordable bite from some really nice ladies this is your spot",1
"1783",4,"Great food. Friendly staff. Just got back with my to-go order and paid for pork belly on my poutine but it's just regular. Kinda disappointed about that.",1
"1784",4,"Hidden gem in the south end (when i said hidden, yes, it was hard to find on google maps). I finally found it (easier to find it on Tremont Street than cutting through Little Puerto Rico). Friendly staff and tasty food. I went with the beef stew over rice (awesome sauce with tender meat), sweet plantains and chicken. Who said you can't find affordable and yummy food in the south end?",1
"1785",5,"FUCK Sriracha. 

East Asian condiments can be SO much more interesting. One of the first things you see when you enter Qing Mu is an array of chili oils and pickled vegetables (extremely fresh and authentic--reminds me of being back in Hong Kong). I recommend munching on the pickled veggies on the side, while adding a hefty spoonful of the chili oil and ginger/scallion mix into whatever bowl you order. 

I ordered the #2, noodles with charshiu (pork belly), chicken, and meatballs. The charshiu was incredible. Not chewy. Perfectly fatty--melts in your mouth. The broth was flavorful yet gentle, a perfect vehicle for the stars of the bowl: the condiments, the meat, the noodles. More on the noodles: these are hand made in house, and it's obvious. They're springy and al dente. 

I was so blown away by this place. It's the best ramen in Atlanta, by far. Hell it's the best Asian meal I've had in Atlanta. The mediocre reviews below make me wonder whether the typical Buckhead crowd (the kind that enjoy eating at the freaking Cheesecake Factory) understands this place. 

Also good for vegetarians (though I haven't tried the mushroom-based veggie broth) and gluten-free folks (they have rice noodles).",1
"1786",5,"Get OTP and enjoy some of the best ""Southern"" cooking there is (just like grandma makes).  Anne and Bill's has been in business since 1974, serving hand-crafted, ""homemade"" meals with a smile.  

I went out on a limb and had a Chick-a-Dilly Doozie sandwich (grilled chicken with Special Sauce, Mushrooms, Green Onion, and Swiss Cheese).  This open faced sandwich was dark & sweet, piled high with mushrooms, and way too decadent.  I loved it.  I suspect the ""secret sauce"" is a beef-bouillon reduction with brown sugar, maybe some soy...  Followed by a serving of banana pudding (which was a little too sweet), and dang, I need a nap.  It was delicious.  

The atmosphere is simply casual.  The staff is friendly and thorough.  And prices are quite reasonable.  Next time I go I'll be sure to try some of the more ""traditional"" Southern fare.  Plus, they serve breakfast all day.  Let me know if you want some company.",1
"1787",5,"This is my favorite affordable asian restaurant ever. 
Pretty much everything is the menu is going to taste really good or decent enough for its price. 

My friends really like their pho but I personally like the other dishes better. 
Their lunch specials come out in huge portion for cheap price!",1

"1789",5,"Great Restaurant! The food was delicious especially the burger sliders. I hardly ever eat burgers, and I would eat those again and again. We also had the duck bruschetta, parmesan truffle fries, beat salad, croquettes and scallops. Everything was delicious. Our server was friendly, informative, and on top of things. Sunday & Monday nights are apparently wine bottle special nights. Select bottles are half price. We had a nice bottle of Sauvignon Blanc for $20! I would highly recommend.",1
"1790",4,"I grew up on hot pot, so I am easily disappointed.  Came for dinner on a Mon. night.  It was surprisingly busy.  My primary complaint is that service was slow and inconsistent, but the quality of meat and the lack of feeling pressured to eat and not linger was far better than other hot pot places in the area.",1
"1791",5,"Dang. Just mad I was too full to try more!

The guy working this truck was super friendly and helpful in explaining the menu, even giving us a nice sample of his amazing pork. 

We got a poke bowl with slaw, and a sunomoni salad on the side. It was all so fresh and flavorful. We spent about $14 total, which was amazing for fresh sushi grade ahi. 

Will return to try more!",1
"1792",4,"This place has a great (albeit small) selection of craft beer. food can be pricey but has always tasted fantastic. I like that their menu changes often. They keep things fresh and they take mods on orders as well. They usually do events with their craft beer like tap take overs or even theme nights. I love coming here from time to time to see what's new. The Parkview is a small place with big flavors on a street where competition for customers can be fierce.",1
"1793",5,"Great quality shirts at an affordable price, and done ahead of schedule - what more could you ask for?  Great customer service, that's what you can ask for...  And Impress Ink delivers!  Friendly, responsive, professional staff including Emily who fielded my web order - thanks for everything!",1
"1794",5,"Best Chinese I've had in Orlando. 

Here's what my daughter and I ordered:

Daughter: Chicken fried rice, egg roll, water
Me: Sesame chicken, egg roll, water. Also requested a bowl of the brown sauce - this really enhanced my meal.

Both our meals were very good.

As an appetizer, the meal came with a complimentary serving of Crispy Wonton Strips. They tasted really fresh and were not too greasy. 

For desert, the meal came with a small complimentary plate of fruit containing pear and orange slices.

As for the restaurant itself, the ambiance was tranquil, the dining area and bathrooms were clean, the parking lot had ample open spots (although we did eat around 4 pm), and our booth and table were comfortable (I was just thinking it's been a while since I've eaten at a table with a glass table top protector..)

The service was good, we didn't wait more than 10 minutes for our entrees, and our waitress was helpful.

All-in-all, I'd recommend Kim Wu if you're in the mood for good local Chinese.

Note: Google Maps / GPS will guided me to the plaza, but not directly to the restaurant, so be aware that it's located at the south end of the plaza.",1

"1796",4,"I went here this past weekend for my birthday dinner. I've been wanting to try Ethiopian for awhile, but, this being my first time, I have absolutely no point of comparison, unlike some of the other reviewers.

The five of us split a bottle of wine. I'm surprised that a previous poster said they charged everyone by the glass--they were out of our original choice, so the server suggested a South African red and brought the bottle out to us.

Only one of us had ever eaten there before, and he suggested we just get whatever combination the server offered. We went for the recommended combination, with a slight variation; since we had three vegetarians out of five diners, the server offered to reverse the ratio of meat to veggie dishes. The food arrived on a giant platter, piled in sections on top of a spongy bread. We also were given a plate with individual pieces of this bread piled on it to tear apart and scoop our food up with.

Everything was delicious. A few things, like the spinach, were pretty much spice-free, but they were great mixed with a little of the spicy sauce or another dish.

This definitely would not be for the less adventurous or more germ-phobic eater (although they do give you hot towels to clean your hands prior to bringing out your dinner, and wetnaps with the check).",1
"1797",5,"Absolutely love this place. Such a unique experience with the cats. Very helpful staff. Also a mean cup of coffee. I will be adopting here soon I hope! :)",1
"1798",4,"Well 85┬░C is finally here in Austin. I've been to many other locations across the country, so like many others, I'm glad its here as it finally shores up something that Austin is desperately missing: asian bakery.

The bread selection here feels smaller compared to other ones I've been to, but its no less fresh. I appreciate them putting the calorie count on the breads. Personal favorites include the boroh almond half moon and the taro. 

As for the drinks, I can't realize advise the tea - it's surprisingly bad that tastes like murky water with equally as bad pearls. I do hear the sea salt coffee is quite delectable though, so stick to their coffee game.

They have a decent size dining area and good cakes too, so grab a friend and sit down and chat.",1
"1799",5,"It's funny that I feel the exact same way as usual about this place.

I didn't even remember my review from last time but the things I said after dinner were exactly the same.

The side dishes they serve are mediocre as usual. Nothing horrible but all just the same fare that is served everywhere; not great side dishes by any standards.

Every other dish we received was amazing! Especially the spicy bbq chicken.

Their hot chicken soup with potatoes had a broth that reminded me of the soup base I had loved at Parks (my favourite Korean restaurant I've been to) in Los Angeles.

(side: the only dish which I wasn't amazed by was the pancake which my brother and I thought tasted too much like burned egg though my fiance and my brothers girlfriend loved the pancake and the egg flavour)",1
"1800",4,"Crispers is one of my favorite lunch spots in Orlando. They offer a great selection of salads, sandwiches, soups, flatbreads, even fresh baked cookies. I like to order their Summer salad (field greens, strawberries, mandarin oranges, apples, gorgonzola, turkey/chicken), tex-mex salad, east coast chicken, baked potato soup, Caribbean flatbread, or when I can't decide I'll do the ""pick a pair"" option. The service at Crispers is always great, and the prices are easy on the wallet.",1

"1802",4,"Delicious, unique tacos within walking distance of my house? I'm in!

Tacodeli has long been a taco must-go in Austin. they have a lot of varieties of fillings and their tortillas are quite delicious. Really awesome vegetarian selections! I tried the Papadulce for the first time this week (Oven roasted sweet potatoes (camote), grilled corn, roasted peppers, caramelized onions, toasted pepitas & a chipotle camote sauce) and it was sooooo good.  Another favorite is the Pollo en Mole. Delicious!

My only complaint is with their hours, only open until 3pm means I can only get there on the weekends (and if I remember to go early, I'm not usually looking to go out for food until dinner time).  It would be so nice to grab tacos on the way home after a busy day.",1
"1803",4,"This is a great place for happy hour and for brunch. Little pricey for a long happy hour, but the half price apps make it a better deal. Awesome bar staff.

"1804",5,"I love this PLACE!!!!! That's all I can really say I have been going to this place for almost 3 years now, and still haven't got sick if it. If you truly want to try real ethnic Indian food, this is the place to be! The decor of the restaurant is beautiful and modern...very unexpected. The service is amazing. The food is soooo gooood. I would recommend Kadahi Lamb and butter chicken and for veggie dishes shahi paneer or alu gobi. Although everything tastes delicious. Drop by this place you won't regret it. PS: they are opening another restaurant in downtown soon.",1
"1805",4,"On a very cold and windy Portland day, I tried this new cart, ordering the Bao with smoked chicken. I was the first customer of the day, and while they said it would be ""just a minute,"" I waited 10-12 minutes for my lunch, watching not one but two chefs do everything but make my food. It would have been fine with me if they'd said they weren't open yet. I would've gone somewhere else, but standing in the cold while they finished prepping was not cool. Actually, it was so cool it was freezing. That definitely put me off. When I got my food, the buns weren't quite steamed enough (maybe rushing because I had been waiting?), but the flavor of the meat and accoutrements were very good. Everything was fresh and high quality. The smoked chicken definitely tasted like an American preparation but fused well. There were lots of sides I wanted to try, but they were a bit on the pricy side, so without knowing the order size, I passed. The Bao was $7 and was definitely a light meal. 

I'd like to go back and try some other menu items once the timing kinks are worked out. My temptation is to call this three stars for the wait, but I'll give them the the benefit of the doubt for being new.",1
"1806",4,"A very cute shop! The gal who worked there was extremely nice and helpful. It seems like most of their items are portland based designers, which is awesome. Things there aren't cheap, but they seem well made and have great silhouettes that I see would be flattering to many different body types. I picked up some super cute and simple hand crafted jewelry that I'm very excited to wear.",1
"1807",5,"This food is and was so freaking delicious. I got the traditional Gyro (lamb and beef) with a grilled shrimp on the side. Omg it was so good I called them and told them will always order from this place when I don't wanna cook",1

"1810",5,"I am ridiculously surprised I haven't reviewed this hotel yet. Since 2004, I've stayed at the Boston Marriott more times than I can count. My family and friends have also frequently stayed here. Whenever out-of-towners are coming to Boston for a weekend, I point them here. 

This hotel is similar to most Marriotts. The hotel rooms are nice and clean. The staff is friendly (one guy at the front desk even remembered me even though I visited about 6-8 months apart), and the lobby is nice. Room service is timely. The high floors have a fantastic view of Boston and Cambridge. 

The main reason I suggest this hotel to visitors is because on the weekend, it is very moderately priced compared to other hotels both in Cambridge and Boston. Usually it's the cheapest ""nice"" hotel I can find on a weekend, probably because Kendall Square historically isn't the most exciting place to stay compared to the rest of Boston. During the week, this hotel is much more expensive, due to the businesses and conferences in Kendall Square. On top of that, this hotel is literally right on top of a T station on the red line. You can walk about 10 feet and be in a subway station, which is fantastic if you're visiting the city. It is also located on the Cambridge side of the Longfellow bridge, which means you have relatively easy walking access to the Esplanade, MGH, Beacon Hill, North End, etc. There are also always tons of cabs waiting outside the hotel- I've never had a problem getting one. Added plus for Starbucks addicts: there is a Starbucks in the lobby. 

As far as the immediate area, Kendall Square is on the back side of MIT's campus. So if that is an area of interest to you, it's a great place to stay. The area used to be relatively devoid of fun cafes, bars and restaurants, but in the past few years, a lot of great options have popped up- Meadhall, Hungry Mother, Bondir, Flour Bakery, EVOO, Area Four, etc.- and a few old favorites are in the area- Cuchi Cuchi, Salts, Emma's Pizza. There's also great lunch options right outside the hotel, such as Cosi's and Au Bon Pain, and there is  a movie theater quite close.

So overall, on the weekends, this place is a great price. There are some fun places to explore in Kendall Square, but it's convenient to just about anywhere in Boston by foot, subway, or cab. If you're coming to Boston or Cambridge for the weekend, definitely consider this hotel!",1
"1811",5,"This was my first time ever eating at cracker barrel. I came in on Thanksgiving day late in the afternoon and this place was packed! Meanwhile I waited I So I did a little shopping in their store. They have some of the cutest things especially for christmas ornaments and for good prices. I even bought some christmas gifts. The Thanksgiving meal included everything you would normally eat in one plate. Turkey, ham, mashed potatoes, gravy, stuffing, cranberry and free drink and apple pie for just $9!! The food was really good and their raspberry tea is so good!! I can't wait to co e here again!!",1
"1812",5,"Cloud Cap is exactly what a good game store should be. Brightly lit, beautifully decorated, friendly owners / staff and a great selection. The shop itself offers a little something for everyone from Magic and Pokemon tournaments to twice-weekly board game nights that are an outrageous amount of fun.

I was nervous about our first trip here, thinking it would be just another grungy, dark, slightly rancid Magic den. I'm so glad I was completely wrong. Even with my horrible social phobia I felt comfortable in Cloud Cap and at our first board game night everyone made my wife and I feel welcome. We will definitely be back for more.

As others have said, this is a great place to check out some new games, either in the store or with the truly excellent rental system.

Next time I need to try their burgers. Hopefully it's as good as their chicken sandwich.",1
"1814",4,"Very nice facility and the best part was we could walk right in on a Friday night and get a lane. The lanes were nice and the facilities were modern and well taken care of. Nice snack bar where the food looked good even though we didn't eat. The only problem was it was a bit pricey during this time as it was over $50 for 2 people to bowl four games, but if we had waited till after 10pm it would have been half the price",1

Back home in Philadelphia, a pool like this would cost someone not staying at the hotel at least 20 dollars. We went on a Thursday afternoon and made sure that we were there right at 2pm for two chairs right by the pool. Don't expect to get a spot anywhere near the pool if you show up after 3pm on a nice sunny day. Great group of people staffing the bar and walking around taking orders. The view was breath taking as you are downtown and can see the river and many other areas of the city. Music was on point, as it was new age house music, and some popular music thrown in as well. Beer was 6 dollars and cocktail were about 11 dollars. Amazing experience all around.",1

Not a bad thing for us at least as we got a great table.  The service was good - although we did feel a bit abandoned a few times while we were there.  
We ordered salads and bruschetta which were served relatively quickly and which were really very good.  I was just surprised how good everything was - I'm not usually a huge chain restaurant fan so it came as a surprise. 
I would recommend it for families, a friends get together or just for couples.  Good food, good service.",1
"1824",5,"Wow, I LOVED this place! Covered patio is like an oasis in the middle of the city.  Food was stellar, and probably the best service I've ever had at a restaurant.

I lived in atlanta for 6 years and the only good pizza I had was from Fellini's. Then I moved to North East (connecticut) and NY and that area's pizza is so amazing you can't compare it to anywhere else! 3 years later I came to atlanta and ate here and I have to say it's just as good as Pizza in NY and CT!! SO good! wouldn't think i can find such pizza in Sandy Springs, GA!!

We ordered:
- Queen's Right: Excellent! very fresh mozzarella and brazil!
- Ring of Fire: Great!
- Mom Says, ""Eat Your Veggies!"": Excellent! I wouldn't think all these many veggies on top of the pizza would make such a great combo!
- Paolo's Pollo: Delicious!! very good :)!

Here is what we had:

maguro sashimi and goat cheese fuji apple, pumpkin seed oil,
black pepper--like butter in my mouth! Who would have thunk, goat cheese with raw fish?

brussels sprouts
crispy brussels sprouts, lemon chili--delish! Chili hotness has faint bite at the end!

jar jar duck countryside farms duck, candied kumquat, endive, rosemary smoke--pleasant surprise, steered away from the hot rock to try this dish since I have never, nor will I probably ever, get to eat duck out of a jar again (until I go back to Uchiko!)

sakana mushi steamed seasonal white fish parcel, galangal, kaffir lime, honshimeji, tomato--so delicious, loved the little mushrooms, and the borth is really great. Eating fish out of a parcel, another new one for me :)

tiger cry cured wagyu, rice paper, red pepper, charred green onion--my boyfriend loved this one, My first bite had too much of the sauce from the bottom, a little too acidic for my taste, but it was really yummy once I moved them from the sauce.

ham & eggs katsu pork belly, yolk custard, espelette--I don't eat pork, bf tried it and loved it as well.

Fried Milk and sweet corn sorbet-- yes you have to get dessert at this Japanese restaurant. The sweet corn sorbet was so amazing, I almost got another order to go!

I don't usually spend this much on food, but when getting what I got last night, I should do it more often. It was totally worth it---2 people, $35, bottle of wine, and getting every dish we wanted= $153. Not nearly as bad as I braced myself for.

We cruised in for light dinner and drinks on a Saturday evening, after warming up down the road, and we were hoping to continue the conversational momentum.  The inside was cozy, dark, and felt very sophisticated.  We sat back near the bar with the other patrons who weren't there for the band.  

The musical act was a quiet, talented little ensemble (channeling Hem), and they brought a small but rabid band of groupies.  We weren't especially noisy, but some of the superfans were shooting us daggers from across the room beacuse we weren't singing along (how DARE we?).

Fortunately, I didn't even care that the little sissy dressed all in black was giving us the hairy eyeball, because I was too busy enjoying the best goddamn crepe I've ever had.  Seriously.  Banana and Nutella.  It was partially-hydrognated bliss.

"1833",5,"I first heard about Eden East at SFC's farm to plate dinner this year when they served an amazing smoked redfish hours d'oeuvre. We made reservations for my dad's birthday and we had a great experience. It was pretty rainy the night of our reservation so they moved the table inside the little farmhouse, which had an equally great ambience. Our first three courses included a vegetable terrine with poached egg, cornflake fried grouper, and a Caesar salad with house smoked ricotta. We were already pretty full at this point, and were shocked to receive an 8 oz tri-tip steak perfectly seasoned and seared! (I'm not normally a meat eater and I scarfed it down.) Our last course was a peach and plum tart with honeycomb. All the food and delicate flavor pairings were perfect. 

While the restaurant is BYOB, they are sponsored by deep Eddy vodka so they have a little cocktail tip bar. The night we were there, I had an Arnold Palmer with the sweet tea vodka. Nothing too impressive, but a nice surprise since we only brought wine. 

Service: our waiter was very kind and did a great job of pointing out where every ingredient and was from, whether it was Springdale Farm or a farm down the road, or Italy. However, our waiter was not very familiar with the menu, and couldn't answer many of our questions without going back and asking the chef. He kept excusing himself by telling us it's a different menu each week. Also, we had some dietary restrictions that we told them about when we first made our reservation, but our waiter knew nothing about it and we had to tell him a few times to make sure our dishes came out correctly. I would've expected more preparation from such a fine dining establishment. 

All in all, great restaurant and great environment. We will go back!",1
"1834",4,"Most of my review of the Central Square location applies here too: generously portioned food that unfortunately is a touch bland, an absurd policy that the only patrons who may sit at tables are those who plan on eating (even those tables clearly in the ""bar area""), slow service upon arrival (I just met an old work friend here for a drink and dinner, and I sat for a good 10 minutes before he arrived - and 5 after he showed up - without anyone coming to our table to take an order of any kind), etc.

That said, the staff is super-friendly, which is what gives it the edge over its counterpart down the road in Central Sq. Much roomier feeling too, and it's a great place to watch college football on Saturday afternoons in the fall.",1

We got chips with salsa and guac, the guacamole was really good, I enjoyed it. For dinner I got Sopes Jalisco (Fried homemade tortilla topped with shredded chicken or beef, lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole.) I choose chicken and I did not think this chicken was going to be spicy because based on the description in parenthesis above, there is no mention of the chicken being marinated or spicy. I got the dish with rice which was delicious and the actual fried tortilla was amazing but when I bit into that chicken I almost had to drink my whole margarita in one sip to cool my mouth down. If I had known that the chicken was remotely spicy, I would have skipped it and got the tortilla with no meat. Maybe add something to the menu so people know what's spicy and what's not. We will definitely be back, the spicy chicken didn't hinder my overall experience but next time I will know better to get any pollo!",1
"1838",4,"As far as Newbury Comics go I find this to be one of the stranger locations.  They have rather strange spot on the second floor of the Garage Mall.  They do a rather good job of making use of the space and like most other location I have found that they sport a rather good selection of used dvds.  I do like this location for their kitsch section (or you could call it flair).  One thing that annoys me a bit is for some reason I am normally let down by the comic selection at this location.  You can find a few things but it seems like you are better off going to G center or Newbury st.

I come here almost once every week and order their Tonkotsu Ramen. Flavourful broth, but not overwhelming. I also like the spicy doplet of sauce they add onto each bowl of ramen. Not too powerful and just right for my liking.

"1840",5,"I wanted to write a review on this little Gem in Winthrop.  I have been going here for about 2 years now and have always been pleased with their talant.  I first started coming to this Nail Salon after I had a disaster of a Nail Job done the day of my wedding at a Nail Salon at Square One Mall.  I now have learned the hard way that you never get your nails done in a Mall (Especially for a big event) because they want to take in as many customers as possible they do not care how the end result looks.  I left the Mall so disappointed and on my way home I decided to see if any of the Local Nail Salons near my house could help me.  The first place I went to could not help because they said it would be too much work to undo what the other place had done.. I decided to try one more place and Thank Goodness I stumbled across A & V Nails Salon.  The Ladies their helped me redo the nails that were done at the Mall and Did a fantastic Job.  I knew It being my Wedding day that my hands were going to be photographed so I can not thank them enough for  their help.  I have been going there for Business ever since.  The staff there is very personable and they remember me everytime I come in the door.  They are all very talanted and hard workers.

They had free appetizers set up buffet style though - a spicy mushroom soup and fried dumplings which were both very good. 

I had a shrimp stir-dry with wide rice noodles. Really well done, big portion, lots of flavor, ended up needing a box. My coworker ordered the chicken vermicelli. Came out with a huge, delicious piece of well-cooked chicken but she said the flavor was really lacking and tried to add the mushroom soup to it!!",1
"1843",4,"The food was great, the price is ridiculous! Yes there are a decent amount toppings but I have never in my life spent $25 on the pizza. That said however the ingredients were all delicious fresh crispy the white sauce is awesome, it had all the right amounts of garlic, and the mushrooms were fresh not canned. Great pizza but is the only place that makes Donatos look cheap lol!",1
"1844",5,"I absolutely love this shop. It is clean, bright, and welcoming. Some lingerie stores can feel dirty and a little seedy but this store is beautiful. I am a little in love with the shop owner. She is kind, knowledgable, and has a solid selection of clothing and shoes. Even if she doesn't have what you are looking for, she knows someone who does. She is the pinnacle of what a shop owner should be.",1
"1845",5,"Great little neighborhood breakfast place. I love the Pepper Bacon scramble and the fact that they are open till 3pm. I'm very glad I discovered this place.",1
"1846",5,"After looking around Boston for a Place "" Tattoo Shop "" to do some work "" Nice Work "" I walked into Empire thinking it would be like all of the 14 other Tattoo shops I have been in all over the Boston , Somerville, Allston and Cambridge !! But Totally Shocked by the way the staff acted !!!! Very Very nice and Top Notch service like NO OTHER Shop I have ever been in !!  It was a walk in for a Small Tattoo "" A Tree of Life "" That met alot to be because of my birthday and how much my life has changed for the better and after talking to Amanda about what I needed done , She was Amazing taking only a hour an half with Work that would have taking 2 or more hours any place other than there !!! On top of a price of $150 , Not only was the price right , Again Her  ""Amanda "" Work was Fucking Amazing !!!   So many places told me that my Tattoo would take 3 to 5 hours and cost up to $600 !! For something only  10"" long and 4 "" wide they are totally out of there minds... People if you want to go to a Place, That does not give you the Run around than "" Empire Tattoo "" in Somerville is the place , But Neil and Amanda were great to talk to very very down to earth people.. I did not feel out of place there !!  I will 100 Million % be going back to a place were the price is right and the work is Amazing !!! Fuck Those shops were everyone thinks they are the Cats meow , It not even worth stepping in a shop with guys who think they are better than you !!!!!!!!!!!  Thank you very very much Amanda for my Tree of life , It will truthfully grow on me an with me )O(  Dave",1
"1847",5,"I love the Rock Shrimp! I love the shrimp soup! I love the corn fritters! I will drive a far distance to enjoy it!  Get there early because it gets crowded (no surprise). It has a cool atmosphere with fish to feed while you wait and sometimes they have a band.",1
"1848",5,"first place I stopped after arriving in Orlando at 8am for breakfast w my cousin and godson.  The staff was so pleasant and the restaurant was immaculate.  I ordered pancakes, hash browns and sausage.  Britt ordered French toast, eggs and sausage.  Everything was PHENOMINAL!  Prices were very reasonable also and I definitely recommend !",1
"1849",5,"Best Mexican food in Atlanta and great service! Love the fresh, thin chips and hot salsa! I have been coming here regularly since they opened and everything is consistently good",1
"1850",4,"For a variety of breakfast tacos, this place has it all. The food and prices are great! Queso is very good!  If you are seeking low carb, you can request any of the taco concoctions in a cup which is what we did. 

Be careful of sitting outside under a tree. There are birds that we watched poop on people, poop on food and attack food if you step away with your food unguarded. This place is pet friendly outside with water bowls for your furry family members.",1
"1851",4,"I passed by this place day and night, and glance through the huge windows. It's always stuffed with seemingly happy customers.

I was finally one of them. 

After a long, frustrating day, any food would have sufficed, but the eggplant sandwich and the mac and cheese more than sufficed. Although the service wasn't the fastest (or maybe I was too hungry), it was worth the little wait. The mac and cheese came out melty and scorching hot with a crumbly topping. The sandwich was well crafted, unique, and also delicious. These 2 items were more than enough for two and we ate  so fast that there was still steam coming out of the mac and cheese when we called it quits.",1
"1852",5,"Great place for great food! Decide to travel here from RI on a Friday and arrived around 7pm and was able to be seated right away. I initially had a reservation for 8, to avoid having to wait, but didn't need it. Great and prompt service and the food was season perfectly! I ordered the linguine del mare and my date had the baked ziti. Huge portions and we were only able to eat maybe half of our meals. Also the sangria ranks top five in my humble opinion. Can't wait to warm up the leftover and see how much better the food has gotten!",1
"1853",4,"I haven't had flat bread pizza in a while, but the one my wife and I ordered today did not dissapoint. The crust tasted fresh and flavorful. The cheese was also delicious and complemented the measured amount of tomato sauce. Our meal consisted of the mozzarela pizza with prosciutto as an add-on and a side of truffle fries which we thought were average. The fries were served a little cold for our standards. Overall the portion size was just right for us to share, but be a little bit on the pricey side for the amount we got.",1
"1854",4,"On the pricey side, however this is one of the things I feel is totally worth a bit extra. Food is fresh, staff is excellent. Fish is fresh, this is how you know they are on top of it! Good sales on staple items as well",1
"1855",5,"-Funny/attractive guys working there
-Free weekly tastings
-Convenient location
-Little to no snobbery or intimidating prices

What's not be 5-star worthy? Love this place.",1
"1856",5,"I LOVE this Half Price Books location.  They don't pay well when selling books, but I give it all right back to them (and then some) anyway.  

HUGE selection...I can look around in here for hours and even when I say I'm not going to, I leave with a ton of stuff.",1
"1857",4,"Great local drinking hole/eatery the dining room isn't massive but the food is good. My recommendation is the fish and chips. The fish is lightly breaded and delicious. The service is great and the staff is very friendly.",1

"1859",5,"Perfect cheese, perfect sauce, perfect crust, in perfect proportions. I'd like to try this cheese pizza up against Frank Pepe's.

update: after my latest visit, I'm going to take it down a notch. Went for lunch, there was a long awkward line. It's clear that the staff were overrun. My pizza came out noticeably crisp--it was obviously not Emma's typical pizza, but they served it anyway. The crust was hard and unyielding, and tasted slightly burnt. High standards include consistency.

update: went again...yummy. $1.50/slice, wow. back to 5 stars. Best in Cambridge. Closest competitor is Il Panino.",1
"1860",5,"The food is delicious and the service is excellent.   Simon, our waiter, made our dining experience wonderful!!   This is my new favorite spot.",1
"1861",5,"Awesome place. Fancy and can be pricy. Their steak salad is really good and they have good wine selections. Outside is super cool with the nice tiki touches being lit in the warmer months.",1
"1862",4,"I usually favor local places, but this is definitely one of my favorite chains. When I am not in the mood to count calories and I want some good comfort food, Cracker Barrel never lets me down!

I have visited this location in person and ordered takeout. I feel like the portions and quality are better in person, but the takeout is not bad by any means. The servers at this location are always spot on. Everyone I have encountered has been friendly and attentive. 

I usually switch between the chicken and dumplings and the chicken fried chicken. For sides I love the macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes (they do need gravy though), and the turnip greens. The sawmill gravy here is delicious and everything always comes out hot and delicious. 

I enjoy Cracker Barrel for their familiarity and their hospitality. If you want a good, stick to your ribs meal served by a friendly face this is a great choice!But please bring back Brad's wife (had to throw that meme in there, if you don't know it Google it haha.)",1
"1863",5,"Been a member for a year now and couldn't be happier with it. In much better shape than I was a year ago. I've done a lot of traveling so have been to probably 10-15 different gyms (known as boxes in cross fit lingo ) so in comparison this is what I like about Crossfit Boston:

1. Great trainers and great programming. Enough said. 
2. Small enough that there is a sense of community and you know the people there, big enough that there are lots of options for when you can do classes. 
3. Open Gym - even if there isn't a class in session you can come in and workout whenever you want. This is a huge plus for me as I like to do extra lifts on my own and most gyms don't offer it.
 
So is it perfect? Ok, lets be honest, the facility isn't the prettiest in the world. Definitely have been to crossfit boxes with nicer facilities (also been to many with worse). But its big enough and has everything you need, and if you are choosing your cross fit box based on how pretty it is, I'd say you've probably got the wrong priorities. 

Overall, love this place and sad that I'll be leaving it when I move back to New York this summer.",1
"1864",5,"this is the my favouriye costco in the lower mainland. the parking spots are very spacious so no need to be afraid of accidents. theres also a much larger selection than the one by production skytrain station",1
"1865",5,"We came for the burgers because I was craving one all week. It was my turn to pick a place for date night, did a search, and found Kay's on Yelp. We we're not disappointed. It was honestly the best burger I've had in years. Kay's is definitely on our list of go to paces for a good drink and an awesome burger, we will be back again soon.",1
"1866",4,"My favorite doughnut (maybe tied with fresh Pip's) is here and it's not a flavor I'd typically be drawn to. The buttermilk lemon poppy seed, tho... stole my doughnut heart. 

Overall, I like their buttermilk, but find their brioche and cake looking doughnuts to be too soggy which grosses me out. 

You *will* spend a pretty penny, so choose wisely.",1
"1867",5,"Our waitress Samantha was awesome. Great recommendation for the pork shoulder and our other dish (mussels) was also delicious. Cobbler was very good and banana pudding is also a great choice. Samantha was attentive, prompt, a great waitress to share stories with. Would definitely go back to see her again!",1
"1868",5,"I am really really picky about my hair, I only use Aveda color (it just works best on my hair) so I found this place on the Aveda website and they are close to my house so I decided to give them a try and I am so happy I did.  Laura is the owner and she couldn't be nicer the whole staff is so sweet.  They are a smaller salon (in an old house that is super cute) and every person I met took the time to talk with me and made me feel so welcomed.  Denise did my highlights and cut, she did a fantastic job, the color looks so natural and beautiful.  I have only been in Austin for a few months so I was stressing about finding a new salon, this place was the first one I tried and will be the salon I will always go to.  If you are looking for a new place I would recommend this salon, I'm sure the whole staff is great, they seem to have very loyal customers.  When people go out of their way to make you happy it shows and I am a very happy customer!!",1

"1871",5,"I have been shopping for new appliances for my new house and haven't found it to be a pleasurable experience.  I never thought of Ferguson for appliances but found out on the Jenn Air website they carried their products.  The showroom is nicely appointed with kitchen showrooms carrying a wide variety of, Bosch, Kitchen Aid etc.  The showroom also has a wonderful selection of faucets, tubs and sinks.

I left the showroom with a quote for what I was looking for and a great price compared to others.  Salesperson was very friendly too!

If looking for higher end appliances I would definitely check the out!",1
"1872",5,"I came across this place while on vacation. We were tired of the parks junk food and wanted something a little healthier. All I can say about this place is wow! We ordered the baked feta which was delicious and the chicken kabobs and it is the best Mediterranean meal I have ever had and I eat it quite often. This place is so good we made sure to return once more before we left town.",1
"1873",5,"Wow this place is such a value, $16 for three tacos a house salad and rice which is so worth it because this is all fresh and delicious. The margaritas are like $9 for a glass so buy a pitcher for $30 and it's easily worth the value. Everything here was amazing and the service was an 11/10!",1
"1874",4,"Geez I haven't been here in years. So anywho me and the head made it all way over here to try and look at some window treatments. We were looking for the bali and the velour collection. (Spelling) we shopped around for some quotes and it seems like JCPenney and actually had the better savings. We found exactly what we wanted and the young lady Lauren who worked in the window treatment department was very helpful. We are definitely going to get our window treatment from here in the next couple days. The overall store seemed really did but it was neat and at what we wanted.",1
"1875",4,"Very well organized and clean.  Employees were pretty slow in the store and at the register.  It was like they were uniformly moving in slow motion- very bizarre.  

The parking lot was huge.  The selection and variety in the store was impressive.  It's like if TJ Maxx could be organized... it might be this excellent. 

I went in looking for white t-shirts, of all things.  I ended up purchasing a variety of items that were on my list to buy from Target because they were 1/3 the price I was expecting to pay.  I was shocked at the deal.",1
"1876",4,"Consistency and quality of food and service are the draws for us to return, again and again.

This evening we had lots of small plates, instead of the normal appy and main.  We got to try many more items, and enjoyed them all, yet we still ordered the octopus AGAIN!!!

Servers are great about allowing you tastes of wine before buying a whole glass!!",1

I scoured Boulder for the perfect aesthetician and am so excited to feel like I have finally found it!  The shop is conveniently located upstairs in the REI complex, across from Jai Ho Indian Restaurant. The receptionist was very friendly and was able to locate my appointment immediately (which I booked online with ease!)

The service went so well and Corinne was so nice to talk to.  I went home with several of her business cards - as they prefer word of mouth recommendations instead of tips.  I look forward to returning for more services and recommend this place to anyone looking for quality waxing at reasonable prices!",1
"1879",5,"Had an awesome dinner on Tuesday night at this place.  It's in the new Doubletree Hotel here in Dunwoody !  Great music, outstanding atmosphere and best chicken and waffles I have ever eaten!! This place is going to be the next big thing - I'll definitely be back!",1
"1880",5,"The best authentic Greek food in Austin hands down! The restaurant is family owned and the owners always make you feel like family when you're there! I could drink a gallon of their sangria! The lamb gyros are amazing as well as the spinach pies and feta fries! They have a really good selection of domestic beers and some Greek beer and wine :) the patio is also really beautiful with grape vines growing on top (when the Texas heat doesn't dry them out) I know they have live music on weekends but haven't made it out yet. My friends love it and have been  a million times!  We often meet up here for drinks and dinner every payday :) Clearly I love this place... Give it a try if you love Greek food!",1
"1881",4,"Ron Howard has always confused me. He was all black & white in Mayberry, right? And then when I watched Happy Days & American Graffiti, I guess I must've thought they were actually filmed in the 1950s, because when I saw him in, say, 2001, talking about a movie he'd directed, I thought: sure, he's no fresh-faced Richie and certainly grown up from Opie, but apart from the hair loss: WOW, he's really held up! Just how old IS he?! 

By the time he was the disembodied voice of Arrested Development, I'd given up trying to figure it out and was dreaming that Ron & I were madly in love. Well, one dream, anyway.

Um, so what were we talking about? Ah, Fairley's. Yes.

When we walked into this corner pharmacy & soda shoppe, we checked out the menu and asked about the egg cream: what is it? The girl behind the pharmacy counter called down some stairs to someone named Cuddy? Cubby? Fairley? and a voice came up: soda water, cream & chocolate syrup. And egg. 

She smiled and nodded as she relayed to us that Ducky (I'm just gonna go with that) was the resident expert on all things soda-shopped. She said he'd be right with us. Excellent. 

We settled into our seats at the original fountain counter and gawked and waited. 
It's old, folks. Not the new made to look old that's all the rage. It's well-preserved but also wooden and well-loved and a little dusty in the corners. It has been there since the place was built.  And people still get their drugs at the pharmacy. As well as romance novels and greeting cards. So it's got a little Walgreens feeling mixed in.

The fountain selections are generally simple. The ice creams are from Umpqua or Tillamook, one of the standards, and served as milkshakes or scooped into Corelle bowls, just like at  grandma's house. And there's a short list of old-timey specials, such as the Yoohoo-esque egg cream and the acidic Green River phosphate. The ones Ducky knows all about.

My expectations of Ducky were set. I was ready for the grandfatherly antique-store expert to school us on how pharmacies worked in the olden days, and how soda fountains used to exist so the medicine could get mixed in to something more palatable, a la Mary Poppins. I expected him to pop his gnarled knuckles and wiggle his white mustache while his eyes crinkled behind smudged glasses. 

Instead, up from the basement pops a fresh and friendly face, with all the swagger, enthusiasm and endearing awkwardness of every high-school student. We had ourselves a real live soda jerk! I got all kindsa lost in time. How old are you? How old am I? Where is this place in time? I still don't know for sure, but I think Ron might like it. I'll take him there in my next dream.",1
"1882",4,"Good for a quick and low cost lunch!",1
"1883",5,"I have been here a couple of times before, but never for dinner until this weekend. Fowler House is known for their pizza and pub fare, but I tried one of their new menu selections- pan-seared Salmon w/  tomato/spinach risotto. It was delicious! The salmon was cooked perfectly. It was also quite a large portion! The service was prompt and friendly, as well. Overall, this is a a friendly neighborhood restaurant with great food. Also, a good place to grab a beer and watch the game with friends. I'm sure I'll be back.",1
"1884",5,"My first time to a tapas restaurant/bar. A friend did the ordering, which everything was outstanding.  We ordered a bunch of different things including paella and shared.  Also a plus they have happy hour specials!  I loved the sangria so delicious! Some of the group tried other drinks including the Lucia which was amazing! The staff was very attentive and helpful for picking from the menu.  I want to go back and take my husband next time!",1
"1885",5,"Great spot! Fresh and authentic! 

I stopped in here for lunch after reading all the other great reviews. I opted for the green burrito which was excellent and good sized. The queso was pretty standard, but tasted better with the Negro Modelo I washed it down with. 

The menu is large, so there's something for everyone. I'd highly recommend his spot you may never notice otherwise.",1
"1886",5,"Had fresh beef noodles, crispy seafood noodles, seafood soup, and salad rolls. They were all really amazing. The freshly made beef noodles were especially good. Would definitely recommend.",1
"1887",4,"They have got to have some of the best burgers I've ever had, and their fries?! AWESOME. I'm only giving the 4 stars though because of 1)price... yeesh, and 2) sometimes the wait can be crazy. I get that the reason you have to wait is because they won't take your order unless there's an open table, which also means people can't take tables for their party while the others are waiting in line. It's actually very smart, but man when I'm hungry I AM HUNGRY. It's worth the wait, don't get me wrong, but still no one likes waiting right?",1
"1888",5,"Totally worth the trip! Best donuts in Boston for sure. Stick with the classics if it's your first time maple bacon, hazelnut butternut and the toasted coconut are our go to flavors! Make it there before 1 on the weekends or they will sell out! And when they sell out they close up shop! So if your heart is set on a hot and fresh donut, get there early! There's is street meter parking sometimes it's hard to get a spot. Also seating inside is limited, but there's a lot of nice places to take a seat outside and people watch. All in all a must try and after you try you'll be hooked! :)",1
"1889",5,"I was surprised on how good and fresh their sushi was! It was a little out away from the city or convention center, but because of that there was no line or crowd! I was a little bit wary that it was not busy, but don't let that trick you! It was delicious and I was impressed with their service and food quality.",1

"1891",4,"Man, this place is the best! First off, it was too cold outside for the slushie but we still ordered delicious drinks! The venue is fun and the outside patio is one of the best. Loved the music they were playing and loved that we could sit there for hours and drink amazing drinks with cool people. Loved the pink flamingos too!",1
"1892",5,"Very modest looking shop, great service. A simple apt door key I have, Home Depot FAILED 3 times in copying it successfully. This shop did it with no sweat, also copied my old 1982 vintage Benz key, works perfectly with the first try. $5 for a vintage car key, seem very reasonable to me!",1
"1893",4,"You can find almost anything that you would find in Shaws but at quarter of the price, no kidding. 

The only con is that they don't carry organic meat, and poultry. Also, there organic produce sections is small.

I only wish that they would improve the general feel of store, spruce it up a bit.l",1

"1895",4,"This is just outside Superstore. I've been waiting for a while for this place to open and have been counting down the days with my good girl friend.

The line ups are still long 'cause it's still new. 

The truth is that it's over priced naturally fruited bars. Like a glorified Popsicle that you can get drizzled with chocolate and nuts. Think Purdy's ice cream bar but made with gelato on a stick.

The line up was very disorganized and the lady managing the line didn't seem to have any common sense on how to make things efficient.

The bars itself were really good.",1
"1896",5,"I have been coming here for the almost 3 years and have never had a bad experience!  I see Ilana and think she is awesome! and I have never had a problem with any of the receptionist or anyone else. I LOVE everything about this place!!!",1
"1897",5,"This is our favorite special occasion location!  But the best part is that the happy hour specials and Sunday half-off wine night make it an accessible watering hole as well. The service is always great and you never feel like they are trying to rush to turn the tables over. The crab bisque is to die for and makes a great dipping sauce for the warm bread. I would recommend the maple plank salmon, filet, half chicken or the chicken tortilla soup; I love when you can see the ingredients and they pour the broth over top at the table. The dim lighting and candles make for a great ambiance. Ohh and did I mention the chocolate cake?? Delish!! Enjoy!",1
"1898",4,"Me and my partner just moved into this neighbourhood and were looking for some place to get a hot meal while we started painting and gutting our house. We were drawn to roots because it looked clean, modern and friendly from the exterior and we had seen the coming and going of regulars and other customers. It looked like a friendly, popular place to go in our new neighbourhood so we thought'd we'd scope it out! 

We were not disappointed -- the staff were friendly, the food was great and the atmosphere was very comfortable. We had been mourning the loss of our usual cafe as a result of our move, but I think we've found a home at Roots. Their milkshakes are delicious and will no doubt become an after work/school treat!",1
"1899",5,"So my wife and I came here to get haircuts from some great hair dressers that I greatly admire. Laura took care of mine and Joshua took care of my wife. She came out with an awesome dapper hair do and I LOVE my super cute cut. My wife and I are picky clients and I'm happy to say I had no worries the whole time.  Thanks guys!!! Only the best!!!",1
"1900",5,"Excellent choice for a vegetarian thali, tandoori salmon or lunch buffet. Really nice layout for couples/parties of 2 - they have 5 tables for two arranged next to the big front window - it's cozy, great for watching the world pass by, and not too loud for a good conversation. Plus they score huge points for safely storing a cell phone I accidentally left at the table overnight - I didn't even realize it was gone until the next morning and I rushed over right as they opened - they had my phone safely placed in the back by the register waiting for me. So in addition to great food it's also run by really good people.
Also, in response to some of the other reviews, the bathroom was perfectly clean even on a busy Saturday night and the service was fine (nothing exceptional but they brought what we needed when we needed it).",1

They are great about cancelled appointments, understanding life gets in the way, and quick to find another time.",1
"1903",5,"They did a fantastic job and the service was great! Brian Anderson and Carl Francis were very helpful! Coming back here airways",1
"1904",5,"Great for late night, nice and quiet and the staff are always welcoming, they made us feel right at home without making us feel pressured to order the second we got inside the restaurant. Very clean, with fresh food, and they bring your own coffee pot if you order coffee, which in itself is impressive and I love going here",1
"1905",5,"Really cool hipster cafe in Deep Cove. A nice warm feeling with a park nearby to drink and eat if you don't want to sit and eat. It is nice in here, therefore, I say stay. They serve Moja coffee which is my second favorite next to Parallel 49. Lots of gluten free options. The buckwheat crepe took me a while to get used to in terms of flavor and texture but it grew on me.  Great customer service.",1
"1906",5,"I was having a bad-day so my boyfriend had flowers delivered to me .
He sent me lilies, which he knows are my favorite .

Very impressed !",1

Can't wait to visit again this week since I am back in town!",1

"1909",4,"Loved this place. Came here for the last day of Dine Out Boston. They had so many choices compared to other restaurants that we couldn't turn them down. We sat outside since the weather was beautiful. We came right in the middle of their 'happy hour' for oysters for $1 a piece! Ordered a dozen right when we sat down.

My friend grabbed an Old Fashion and I grabbed the Bermuda Swizzle, which tasted like an iced tea. It wasn't a bad thing, since I'm not fond of strong liquor tastes. For our appetizers we decided on the fried oysters, which were delicious and the duck risotto. We also had a few Joe's Deviled eggs at a $1 each. Our entrees were the Lobster Thermidor and Beef Wellington. Both were phenomenal. Lobster had nice sized pieces and the gnocchi was nice and soft. Beef Wellington was perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned. We ended it was the donuts and homemade coffee ice cream. The ice cream has a great coffee flavor.

Would probably come here again, but the Dine Out Boston deal was great. Saved lots of $$ from that.",1

My BFF since 7th grade was in town for a work conference at hotel. We met for dinner with our other lifelong friend who lives here in town. It was great to spend time with them and catch up. Add in great food - it was a great night.

Thanks to Yelp's Elite Event we had at the Mexican restaurant here, I had a 50% coupon for my next visit to the hotel. We made a reservation that day and had no problem getting in.

We each got a steak. I had the sirloin and shrimp. The others each got the filet. We split a cesar salad (which would have been a meal in itself). For accompaniments we got the asparagus, lobster mac & cheese and onion rings. The servers joked they were more like onion donuts. Which is an accurate description.

Everything was cooked to perfection. Courses were timed well - especially since we were looking to talk and enjoy each others company. 

We skipped dessert. Next time? 

The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. I had a great evening.",1
"1911",5,"Best Sushi I've had anywhere in the Portland metro.
In addition to their amazing dishes, they also serve beers from their neighbor business, Roscoe's (typically 20+ beers on tap).
Always a great experience in terms of food, drink and service.
Bonus that it's located in Montavilla neighborhood.",1
"1912",4,"I was actually surprised at how good the tour was. Very informative. Whether you go into it a complete novice or you are a chocolate expert, you will pick up some good information on how chocolate is made. Before you go on the tour you have an opportunity to buy some chocolate made onsite. The place also has a very competent cafe and my girlfriend and I ordered a couple of sandwiches prior to the tour. The food was very good. The tour seemed to last a good half hour or so. You are stepped through the chocolate making process beginning with the growing of cacao trees. There are also some nice historical factoids you'll learn. The highlight of the tour is at the end when you get to sample many different chocolates ranging across the spectrum of cacao content--from milk chocolate to dark chocolate. And each sample offers interesting flavor hints such as vanilla and chili pepper, to name a few. The tour guide was top notch. You could tell she loved her job. She was very engaged. If you purchase a tour you receive a discount on everything in the gift shop that day. I think this is a nice place to visit for an hour or two if you have any level of interest in chocolate.",1

"1914",4,"The mom and pop feel to this restaurant is great and I really like the service. Their fresh bread and baked goods are top notch for sure. I really like the schnitzel, spaetzle, and cabbage, but feel they need to take the vegetables up a notch. They are often over cooked and some are frozen instead of fresh. The dill pickle soup (yes I know it sounds weird) is definitely worth a try, but I make it better myself at home.",1
"1915",5,"As a restaurant to spend an anniversary dinner, Journeyman was an excellent meal and executed remarkably well. I went there the other night with my wife to celebrate our 2nd anniversary. We each got the 5-course omnivore meal and split a plate of charcuterie.

The opening amuse bouche was fantastic. It consisted of thinly shaved ham that had an excellent salty taste without being too fatty or too salty. It was served with white beans topped with lardo. The fattiness of the lardo was a great combination with the warm earthiness of beans

Our charcuterie plate was great (2 types of pork rilletes, squab pate and beef hearts). The beef hearts had a great beefy-flavor without being overpowering. It tasted like meat rather than offal, and even my skeptical wife liked them. The smoke pork rillete was amazing. Great smoky taste that went really well with the bread and accompanying mustards

Other highlights included a bowl of gnocchi that had a great texture (read: not too heavy), although a bit dry. The pieces of duck that were served with it were excellent, and meat accompanied the pasta really well.

Our main course was a smoked pork shoulder, which was really good. The meat was very soft and you could taste some of the smoke without it being overpowering. The cut was rather fatty, but the fat was actually pretty good, and I didn't find the fat to be too cloying in my mouth

Desert was a theme of rhubarb, including a rhubarb sorbet and a donut filled with rhubarb filling. It was like a jelly munchkin from D&D, but 100 times better.  

Our total meal time for all six courses was over two hours, probably closer to three, but it was paced really well and we knew that it would be a long meal. We never felt that we were waiting for an excessively long time between courses, and never got hungry while waiting for the next course to come out.",1
"1916",5,"Eric is the friendliest and most competent person I know. Everything is transparent and they always follow through. I've sent at least 4 friends and he's always taken care of everyone. One time I showed up late in a rush and he got my screen repaired in 5 mins.",1

They have everything for everyone on that menu including for kids and huge platters to share, with 4-6  people. And their not stingy at all with their food.

"1919",4,"Lee James Floral did my beautiful small elopement wedding at the Four Seasons Resort in Orlando, FL.  

I began working with him in June of 2015 through my wedding planner, Brandee Gaar of Blush by Brandee.  I had specific style ideas of what I wanted and where based on a few photos I had found online and Lee and Brandee put their heads together along with the staff at the Four Seasons to make it happen. 

I had some specific button/pom pom dahlias that I wanted that I wasn't able to get but Lee called all over and had dahlias flown in from everywhere to try to make it happen.  In the end, it didn't, but I was able to get the style and look I wanted and my flowers were still absolutely beautiful. 

I liked that Lee called me to keep me updated on the status of the flowers as I had indicated having issues in the past with florists substituting flowers of a different kind for those I had said I wanted.  I appreciated that - it's a way to manage expectations and make sure no one is disappointed (or as much as they would've been day of).

Lee also did my small rehearsal dinner at the Four Seasons as well and made arrangements for that table setup - it was much simpler than my wedding but still beautiful and classic. 

I loved working with him - he was bright and cheery and excited about making my vision come to life with some of his own stylish flare and he really got into helping make my spaces beautiful for such a small and intimate wedding.  

In the end it was beautiful and he was a joy to work with.  I couldn't be happier.",1

Their hotel airport shuttle even drove me downtown for free.  They have a small tennis court and free rackets and balls to use which was nice.  Another guest had a cat with them that at one point followed me back to my room and ran inside when I opened the door.  Being a cat person I thought this was hysterical and spent a few minutes petting the cat before putting him back outside.  Only thing this hotel needs to improve on is the hot water- ran out while i was showering.  Other then that a very pleasant stay.",1

positives:  Food is pretty good.  Service is as well.  Went there for dinner with another couple. My buddy and I got the steak - I thought it was pretty good.  My wife got some shrimp dish and she said it was ""o.k."".  My buddy's wife got the eggplant dish and liked it.

The ice cream sandwich desert is a bit misleading.  It's cookie sandwiches.  None of us liked it (it was huge and enough for 4, too bad it kinda sucks).  Everything else was good.   Martinis were all a hit - they're the bigger martinis no the joke tiny things that some places try and sell you.  I had a dirty martini which was really good and another pepper and olive with blue cheese martini.  I didn't love that one.  Wife got a cosmo kind of martini and loved it.  Buddy and wife were having the pineapple infused ones - she loved, he said it was a girl martini (then why'd you get two, bro??).  Lol

The lamb burger is awesome in my mouth. I recall the beef tartar being pretty good. I'll try most any special that is recommended by their staff.

It's more like fresh, gourmet cuisine that happens to come with a bun. Wonderful food and a pretty cool atmosphere, but hard to cope with on a $22 hamburger ticket - ya know what I mean?",1

If you are looking for a genuine, earthy, and hearty bowls of noodles (both with soup or not), then visit Chen's.

When you come inside, or make it into the door if you're lucky you are instantly transported Ito Mexico.  You know it's good when everyone inside speaks Spanish and isn't a tourist.  

Took about 20 min to get a table and only because there were only two of us. The menu is extensive and with items I have never seen anywhere. This is no Taco Bell or ""on the border"" people. This is real Mexican food!  Prices are great and food even better.  Stop here and eat, you won't be disappointed!!!",1

"1941",4,"Large portions of GOOD food. (Bacon was awesome!) Service was quick, friendly, and accommodating, and the prices were great. My sister suggested taking our folks out for brunch, and I suggested Black Bear primarily because it was close to a bookstore I wanted to visit. We all agreed it was a GREAT choice!

The 7-grain almond pancakes were notably tastier than the regular pancakes and certainly worth the small surcharge. Hollandaise was mediocre, but the syrup and real fruit toppings were great. And oh my goodness the bacon... *drool* I eat it very rarely, so when I do, I greatly appreciate it being thick, savory, and crispy without charring. I could easily have eaten a plateful. (Which is why I eat it so rarely. Is there a Bacon-holics Anonymous?) The hash browns and California scramble were also delicious. So far as I sampled (from everyone's plate), there's no way to go wrong on their breakfast menu, which is served all day.

Given the amount of hiking my parents and I have done in Yosemite, it was nice to eat surrounded by black bears and not have worry about them eating our food... or us.

TRIVIA: A 2007 Columbia University study linked bacon consumption to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, due primarily to sodium nitrite.  Each typical slice is 43 calories and the fat is 1/3 saturated. And Black Bear bacon is so darn good I really don't care. Bring me more!",1

"1944",5,"Now I understand it when someone describes a defining food. We ordered a cheese pizza and a pizza with many meats, as well as their grilled lamb, beef, and sausage bbq. This cheese pizza was amazing: the cheese was stringy, but not too much, had appropriate saltiness and creaminess; the sauce was tomato rich with the appropriate amount of herb-i-ness; and the crust was perfectly thin, had a great taste, texture, and was not left as an unloved handle on anyone's plate. I can't avoid comments that a pizza should consist of more than a single non-cheese topping: in my humble opinion this hides any short-comings in the pizza. There was no need to hide anything about this pizza. The best of the grill items was the sausage, resulting in fork prong hand attacks when I attempted to take the last piece. the beef was salted appropriately and a second favorite behind the sausage. The lamb was chewy (no fork attacks for that lone piece). CASH ONLY. Boston surly included for free, adding to the ambiance. I will revisit again, especially as it is a few blocks from the Boston Embassy Suites near Logan",1

"1947",5,"My husband birthday was yesterday and I wanted to wow him last nite. Capital Grille did that and exceed my expectations. I could type a lot of things, but everyone that reviewed this place says it all. The food here is wonderful and the staff is very nice. My waitress name was Natalie, she is awesome and knowledgeable about the food menu, but most importantly the wines. I told her what I had a taste for and she recommended a wine without looking stuff up. She was very attentive and she made my husband birthday dinner just that much more special. 

The food was amazing.

Appetizers: Calamari - perfectly fried, Tuna tartare was so good. ( just got to try it).

We both had the Lobster Bisque with a little sherry. Lots of lobster chunks and the sauce was good and rich.

Entrees: I had Halibut and he had the citrus glazed salmon both had great flavors and was just awesome.

Something to note, if you are looking for truly authentic and amazing Italian food, this is not the place for you. Take a walk up to the North End if you want that.

But if you want decent to pretty good Italian food and large portions, this is the place for you. I would consider this ti be a step up from say the Olive Garden.

The restaurant is setup nicely and it is clean. The menu is solid and offers all the Italian favorite, Chicken Parm, Chicken Marsala, spaghetti, etc. Prices are not too steep, but keep in mind the portion are amazing. Every time I go, I usually end up taking something home. They have great desserts, Nanas pound cake is amazing. This place is great for groups and they even have rooms downstairs for functions. Its fun to look at all of the celerity photos that are scattered along the stair case and the area by the bathrooms.

A draw back would be the bar area, it's not that great. Also, this place gets very busy during the Friday and Saturday night rush. It's not uncommon for there to be an hour plus wait. It's in a great location in Park Square. If you are taking public transportation, the Green line stop at Arlington is your best bet. The #9 bus also has a stop right near here along with the #39.",1

"1953",5,"It's official. After just two visits I'm willing to proclaim The Conquistador as my new home away from home in inner SE PDX. Let's break it down! 

The Style:
There's no confusion about the imagery of choice at The Conquistador - if you've been looking for a place to drink in Portland while surrounded by black velvet and carved wooden art featuring 16th century Spanish Empire warlords, this is your spot! The art is kitchy, it's elegant, it's divey, it's hip, it's awesome. 

Mix in the black vinyl booths, dim '70s candle lighting, and even a fully functioning 1980s era juke box (replenished with a nice array of past & modern jams), and you've got a place my pops would've been right at home in 40+ years ago. 

(Oh and don't forget the decent-sized sidewalk patio on front!)


The Drinks:
There's something for everybody here...solid wine options, cheap bottle/draft beer, and a wide variety of finely-crafted cocktails...if you like booze, you'll be happy. 


The Food:
It's fresh, it's veggie-centric, it's flavorful, and it's excellent. Try the rice & bean bowl with any of the house-made salsas (I recommend it paired with a Tecate tall boy) and go forth from there. I'm instantly suspicious of the word ""vegetarian"" being used along side a dark bar, but The Conquistador has made me reconsider my close-minded stance. 


The Service:
We've been helped by outstanding, easy-going folks each time in. Once with just my fiance and I at the bar and another time with a group of 6 at a back booth. Both times the service has been prompt, helpful, and lively. Can't ask for much more. 


Other Entertainment:
There's one pool table, a skinny shuffleboard table, a couple pinball machines upstairs in an interesting crow's nest-like loft (that also features an excellent sparkling gold vinyl couch), plus the aforementioned vintage juke box, room for DJs and apparently a trivia night. 


The Vibe:
Too hip and stylish to be considered a dive...too down to earth and friendly to draw the negative ""hipster bar"" label...it's a place I'd take my parents one night and my kickball team the next. I'm not sure how popular it is or isn't on late weekend nights, but I'm guessing the place doesn't radically change in character. 

The Verdict:
Whether you start or end your night here, you won't be disappointed. Great food, great drinks, great service, great ambiance...a tremendous addition to my swollen Rolodex of PDX favorites.",1
"1954",4,"Excellent service! The textured protein was a bit bland but their house-made hot sauce was a great addition.  I wish they had a few more menu items that weren't meat-specific substitutes; just pure vegetable dishes.",1
"1955",4,"Was just walking down the street minding my own business (very recently stuffed myself w/poutine) when I noticed the beautiful pastries in this little shop.  You kinda have to question yourself if you're eye-ing pastries on an empty stomach...but when you're so full you're about to bust a gut and the pastries still look irresistible (and smells heavenly), you just go right in and grab a couple.

There were two young ladies working behind the counter and both were so sweet and one even had an adorable French accent (direct from Paris, I'm sure)!

I don't know why it's so hard to find good melt-in-your-mouth almond croissants...but it's not as easy as one would think.  Their almond croissant was soft, chewy, crispy, yummy goodness.  Also got a pistachio filled pastry and it also did not disappoint.  One of the remarkable things I really appreciate about French pastries is how light on the sweet side everything is...nothing screaming sweet like buttercream or heavy caramel or dense mousse.

I wanted to (but didn't) get a cup of coffee here but wasn't ready to eat my pastries right away so didn't want to carry it around.",1
"1956",4,"One of the best meals I've had in quite some time. Really like what they're doing here. The food is what I've come to enjoy in modern American cooking. Simple dishes done very well and with quality ingredients. Start with the maple butter served with a hefty basket of bread. That ""wait what is in this butter?"" moment. We ordered the baked brie and hummus as apps and opted to get the chicken wings as well. All of it was on-point and despite being three different dishes they all worked together. I ordered the ribeye which came with blue cheese/bacon butter. Cooked perfectly, and with a pillow of mashed potatoes. A great experience and would highly recommend to anyone in the area looking for a great meal in a good atmosphere.",1
"1957",4,"Went for the gusto and ordered a Dutch baby with a Scotch egg on the side with a hot Brandy Alexander. 

Considering the fact that I had just been driving from Yreka, with images of these foods dancing in my brain meats (I'd Yelped the place last night in my cold hotel room) throughout the hours of snow and rain on the highway, they were the greatest things I'd ever seen once they finally arrived before me. 

Best meal I've had since... oh man, how long has it been? 

It was worth the drive. 

Worth the wait. 

Worth the awkward thinking-our-name-was-called-and-then-sitting-down-to-discover-there-was-also-another-Brandon-Party-of-Three-and-then-having-to-go-back-outside. 

Worth the further wait for the food to get cooked. 

And above all, worth the amount of carbs, sugar, and whatever else people stress absorbing when they eat this well. 

I'd heard about Dutch babies, but never seen one in person, let alone tried one. It was GOOOOOOOD, especially with the lemons squeezed on top and the syrup and the... MMMMMMMMMMM!! 

The Scotch egg was the best I've had, and thank heavens it was hot. Most places I've been serve it cold. I don't know if that's the traditional way, but these were warm and tasted like happiness. 

Great horseradish spread that went with it. THAT went well with Brandon D.'s potato pancakes. 

Will I return? If I ever get to stay in Portland for any significant amount of time, DEFINITELY!",1
"1958",5,"So here's the thing.....

Dear sweet Jebus, if the large bottle of Newcastle weren't enough, if the fried pickles weren't enough, lets talk about the most righteous vegan riblet sammie ever.

Fuck off. 

I wasn't expecting it, after perusing the menu I was toying with selecting either the black bean burger or the vegan riblet sammie, I finally decided to go for broke and pick the riblet, balls to the wall, I figured it would either be the tastiest or nastiest experience of my life. Boy am I delighted it was the tastiest decision ever...

As I powered through my super-sized Newcastle I was checking out the decore, and, if I'm not mistaken, quite a bit of the groovy wares are handmade, the booths seem to be made with love, and upholstered with crocodile, as do the stained wood room dividers, and that kind of craftsmanship makes my heart swell. Add the Patsy Cline on the jukebox, the graff in the bathrooms, and the cushy couches and its mathematically impossibly for you not to have a great time here. 

The deep fried pickles were crispy, hot, and tasty, but the real winner for the evening was the vegan riblet sammie, which arrived to my table glistening in bbq sauce, paired with caramelized onions and pickles, and accompanied by a side of homemade steak fries. 

I added a little mayo to the ciabatta bun, which is rather un-vegan of me(but I'm a vegetarian and I love mayo so suck it), cut the sammie in half one more time and took my first bite, the faux riblet was a little crispy, which is a textural element I can always appreciate. The flavor was insane, the faux meat was seasoned well and super moist, the bbq was a little heavy on the liquid smoke, but at this point I could care less, I was satisfied beyond belief, and as much as I wanted to finish the whole sammie, it was not possible. 

Even my carnivore partner in crime was surprised about how insanely tasty it was. 

God, this sammie is the thing dreams are made of.",1
"1959",4,"Solid.  I got a french onion soup, which was good but slightly too salty.  But it was good.  I only add the caveat because this place is definitely higher end pricey (not too expensive, but still) so the little things count.  But in general the food was 1) plentiful and 2) flavorful.  The waiter was extremely polite and friendly.  I'd recommend for a ""nice but not too nice"" date or for a family birthday dinner.  Fairly quiet so good for conversation.",1
"1960",5,"I have never been to another vet but I felt that my cat was treated well by the vet and the technicians. The office is easy to find and has free parking. I waited less than 10 minutes in a clean, cute waiting room. I will definitely be returning.",1

"1962",4,"EXPERIENCE:
First things first, I'm a serious bakery fiend. When left to my own devices, it's not uncommon for breakfast, lunch, and dinner to consist of baked goods. Hey - I'm not saying I'm proud, nor that it's healthy, but just that it's not uncommon.

I drive by this place often and have long wondered about its legit-ness. Their hours seem to err on the side of being somewhat limited, though coming from me that doesn't say much (a night owl who eats late). Also, they aren't abnormal when taking into consideration that it's family-owned (not to mention a bakery). Hours are:
Mon - Fri:  7am - 6pm
Sat:  7am - 3pm
Sun:  CLOSED
**I do have a bit of a problem with a bakery that's closed on Sundays - but hey, to each their own.

Situated a few doors down from Steinmart (and a stones throw from Alamo Drafthouse), the place really isn't anything to MMS-home about. There are a good number of tables [and chairs] placed neatly outside the entrance, which then wraps around the building to where there is a second entrance.

I strolled in at around 4:30pm on a Tuesday. Baked goods love affair aside, I fully intended to go in for a sandwich only. As one reviewer previously noted, the chalkboard menu is a bit much on the eyes. Worried it might overwhelm my decision-making ability, I asked if there was a menu I could look at. Ah yes! A menu I can hold and examine without the proverbial dude-behind-the-counter-is-ready-to-take-your-order-and-waiting-on-you pressure (or is that just me?). 

I first glanced over the breakfast menu, making a **mental note to visit back during breakfast hours. I then did something completely out of character - though the predictability in me led my eyes straight to the tuna sandwich, I recalled a tip to try the Santa Clara on sourdough. And so... I did. Despite my ordering a sandwich that was a tad on the pricey side (at least for me), I then proceeded to leave a tip that was a bit more generous than my normal 20%. I cannot recall why, perhaps I was feeling proud in my deviation from routine? Who knows.

I was offered a cup of water while I waited, to which I graciously declined. I saw only a few other customers come and go. Some came for coffee, some for baked goodies, and one ordered soup, which they serve in a scrumptious looking bread bowl (**mental note: try the soup in a bread bowl). Already exceeding my expectations, I decided that I rather liked the place.

Engrossed in a game of 'hanging with friends,' I'm uncertain how long I waited. Either way, I was surprised when he offered a free pastry of my choice for ""a longer than normal wait."" I decided on a cinnamon roll.

FOOD:
Sandwich - served with a few large handfuls of chips, the Santa Clara was pretty darn fantastic. The best part would have to be the bread. Seriously. I've never been a huge fan of sourdough, still I assure you that the next sandwich I get from here will again be on sourdough **** INDEED, I will be going back!

Cinnamon roll - as hard as I tried to eat half with my meal and save half for later, I ended up eating the whole thing in one sitting. I give the frosting : cinnamon : bread ratio two thumbs up. It was wonderful.",1

She helps you get the most out of your insurance and takes the time to explain things to you. She stayed open late for me once, and I very much appreciated it. I also found a great pair of glasses in her selection.",1
"1964",5,"Casual dining but better than any Mexican restaurant I've been to before.

Their salsa bar is the best part! There are a variety of salsas to choose from.

This place is clean and nice! 

Be prepared to wait if you decide to go during lunch because it gets busy!",1
"1965",5,"Ok. How CUTE is this coffee shop? Little details in the store makes anyone and everyone feel all fancy and stuff. The service is great and the coffee is wonderful as well! This is the perfect place to take your girls for a coffee date. Kudos to you, pressing coffee!",1

"1967",4,"I have been on a tremendous poke kick lately!

I was excited to find a great Hawaiian place in Vancouver. They seem to have a great happy hour menu, but we arrived shortly after it ended. 

I ordered the edamame to start. I wish the edamame was served warm & salted. I am just not a fan of cold edamame. It tends to break up in my mouth. 

For dinner, of course, I ordered the poke and an order of unagi (eel) nigiri. The poke was deliciously fresh and perfectly seasoned. I appreciate poke when I can still taste the tuna (quality!) and it's not overly saucey. The portion is somewhat small but I am not a big eater. The unagi nigiri was good (not great) and a great way to end my main course. 

For dessert, I had the key lime pie tart. This was delicious. I am normally a big fan of key lime. So this key lime had some big expectations to live up to. Unfortunately, as tasty as it was, I felt like the ratio was off. Too much cream/frosting, not enough tartness lime filling. I felt that it was sweeter than it should've been. 

Overall, great spot for dinner. I would definitely come back often if I lived in the area.",1
"1968",4,"Wish we had the ability to give half-stars.  Solid 4 1/2!

Late lunch today (I'm retired so I can go when places aren't too swamped.)  Had the shrimp specials!  Wonderful flavor, smallish shrimp.  A little salty, but that's to be expected in a chain restaurant.  Stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer were almost the best thing that happened to us here.  The best thing was our server, Brittany.  Lovely young lady whose smile was absolutely beautiful and sincere!  Not obtrusive but more than willing to do anything it took the make us happy.  We took 2 hours and chatted and ate.  I'm still stuffed at 7:30 and we ate at about 1:45.

In short, 5 stars for Brittany and 4 for the food and ambience.  Ask for her,  she's great!",1

Anyway, she nailed it. And it stayed perfect all night.",1
"1970",5,"Start your review...I finally had the pleasure of eating at Bartaco this week. Having worked for a construction company that helped build this, I was particularly excited to see it in full operation.  Mr. Peach and I decided to go Wednesday night around 7pm and we were immediately seated. The ambiance is nice, kinda rustic and beachy, and the serves are all dressed in blue checkered shirts and Converse sneakers. This would be a great place for tapas with girlfriends or a date night. 

The server was extremely helpful and explained how their system for ordering works, which is a menu in which you pencil in your selections and leave them in a placard on the end of the table to be picked up. We decided to get the small taco tray, which consisted of 6 tacos, 2 sides, guacamole and 2 tamales. Typically it's chef choice, but for an extra couple bucks you can choose what you want. We ordered the duck, chorizo, pork belly, shrimp, ribeye, and fried oyster. 

While we waited for the tacos and such, our guac was delivered first and man it's definitely one of the best I've ever had. Really really fresh, not too over seasoned, and chunky. It arrived at the table with baked hard, whole, corn tortillas, I would prefer the chips or to have them precut, but they were so fresh and tasty I'm not complaining at all (just lazy lol). Around this time I attempted to order one of their house drinks, the CLT, but was informed that it wasn't available, but the bartender suggested a spicy margarita in its place, and it was really good. 

Our tacos arrived not to long after, along with the tamales. Our favorites were the pork belly and the ribeye, man they were amazing.  I literally wish that's all we had ordered. The pork belly was sweet succulent had a smoked flavor. The ribeye was to die for. I have never even thought to put ribeye in a taco, but if definitely made its way to the top of the taco food chain in my eyes. Our check was around $40 and worth every penny. Definitely affordable for a couple who takes the 30-minute trip to Buford Highway for tacos a couple times a month, this place may become the substitute.",1

Will definitely be coming back!",1

"1974",5,"Katie is awesome and so are here helpers! I love that frequently when I go, I see her son or her mother or her husband all helping in some capacity if even to keep her company. She is very good and I trust her completely with my pets. I read in the reviews a couple of comments about her canceling appointments or being flaky. And what do we know about the reasons why she may have canceled an appointment or not been available. I can only imagine how many last minute cancellations or no shows she has to live with as she tries to pay her bills. She is a tiny business and may make a mistake once in a while with scheduling but I'm one of the customers who was an accidental no show and has canceled as well and I get it that stuff happens.

My Nicky and Kitty love her and her great support team. She's a family person and treats her customers and visiting clients as though they were family as well. As an animal lover, I can feel that she, too, is an animal lover and treats our pets with respect and kindness.",1

"1976",5,"Friday night dinner with family (wife and 3 & 5 year olds). Like other reviewers before, the outside and location don't match the inside and vibe- totally pleasant surprise. Really good beer selection on tap- probably 10 beers. All local, all from different brewers. My wife and I each had a Moscow Mule. Also very good. 

Menu is rather small, but great variety. There are also a few daily specials. For a starter, we had the creamed corn quesadilla. So, so good. A bit small for most parties of four, but for ours it was fine. For dinner I had chicken and dumplins. Really good also, and not quite as heavy as it usually is. My wife had the salmon special and loved it. Served, interestingly enough, with black eyed peas. Girls had cheeseburger (huge for a kids meal), and mini corn dogs. I tasted the burger- very good. Didn't taste the corn dogs, but our three year old approved. 

Service was really attentive and friendly. Decor was a kind of rustic chic. We'll be back soon.",1

"1979",4,"Delicious burger!  But definately pricey (which is why I dinged a star).  And parking can be a pain but if you're lucky, you can score a spot right in the front of the restaurant!  I had the No.3- Banh Mi Burger which was great but a little spicy due to the jalapenos.  The parmesan garlic fries were to die for!  Yummy!  Next time I will try a shake.  Try to get out there for lunch - 1130 - 330 for the $8.25 lunch which include burger, fries and a drink! cant beat that!! Cant wait to go back!",1

"1983",4,"So good. I love me some German and Polish food, Cafe Polonia serves it up presented well and in a sunny cleanly decorated atmosphere. 

This is not the kind of cafe where you're going to drink cup after cup of coffee soaking up free wifi, go next door to Gulu for that atmosphere. 

We went for lunch wanting to try it without having to refinance our house. The lunch menu offers up some great classic meals, stuffed cabbage, pierogies, pyzy dumplings and weiner schnitzel. We got a mixed pierogie bowl for 2, stuffed cabbage and pyzy dumplings and 2 beers to wash it all down. We managed to eat it all but it was VERY VERY filling

The coconut shrimp is a weird addition to the menu. Odd. 

Everything was presented simply and gorgeously. The flavors were great. Everything was just great. The server was attentive and very good. I found the music volume to be slightly high for my taste.

Prices were at the upper end of what I would pay for lunch, but everything was so good it was worth it.",1

No intro just say your order, I place it and he says 10 mins. Places looks very clean inside, outside a little sketchy but the food is awesome. We ended up getting 2 loaded steaks, which are steak bombs to them. Although they shred the steak way to thin for my taste but they definitely LOADED the sub with a ton of meat. I would definitely come back to get some more.",1
"1990",5,"My last meal while visiting Austin. I walked over from the JW Marriott, two blocks away. As I approached Gus's, I could smell the fried chicken. 

My server was Hunter, who treated me well and gave me advice one the food when I was torn between two or more items. Hunter was friendly. I sat at the bar and he was basically a bartender at heart! 

I had the three wing plate with and extra side of fried okra. For dessert, I had the coconut pie. Also, I had the Fire Eagle IPA from Austin Beerworks.

I was glad to see local beers showcased over the mass beers. But that has been typical in Austin. 

The chicken was great! Large wings that were crispy on the outside and moist inside. This was well done chicken. I could have eaten three more. The slaw and beans were good. The okra was good as well. The pie was really good - a coconut custard pie! 

All this good food, beer, character, and service for just $19. Cheap, good food. My kind of place.",1
"1991",5,"Probably the best carpet cleaning experience we have ever had.  Sometimes when we call the $99 special folks, it's never $99, and the special part is usually that they are in and out in 30 minutes.

Not so with Peace Frog, they spent quite a bit of time in my teenagers rooms (parents out there know what I am talking about), and were able to repair a tack strip in our entry way.   Carpet is much dryer than when other companies have been over.

Very happy, and oh, they are super friendly.  Great experience.",1
"1992",5,"Delicious lamb shawarma. It's pretty big and comes with all the fixins! This is seriously one of the best shawarmas I've had anywhere. Hummus was also VERY tasty. I would think anything on their menu would be good. No complaints. :)",1

Great prices, even on the bigger plants. There's a fun spin the wheel if you spend over a certain amount that usually results in free plants, plus the surprise of free plants with purchase on certain days (3/7 of my last visits), but my favorite portion is the 'fancy' succulents. The quality of each plant in the green house is outstanding. They can arrange your succulent in a pot you purchase for $5 if you want them to handle it. They also offer a variety of top dressings (colorful rocks/glass), as well as air plants, and prearranged pieces. Overall, the prices, variety, and attention to detail (draining hole priorities etc) makes this my top nursery in Austin.",1
"1999",5,"If I had the prowess to open my own restaurant, I'm pretty sure it'd look a hell of a lot like Sauced. First of all, the neighborhood. Maybe I'm a bit (okay, a LOT) biased, but this is the perfect fit. Then, the fun retro decor and vibe without things being over the top. I wanted to spend hours here. Add in the fun vintage drawings on the menu, the comforting food, and friendly service and we've got a real winner on our hands. 

I sampled the soup of the day which was a sweet potato something-or-other, and absolutely awesome. But the biscuit that came with it... oh man. The flaky butteryness put Popeye's to shame (and yes, this is something that Sauced should be proud of). I also sampled the canape (more biscuit goodness) and ordered the skewers: all absolutely delicious, and a little bit different then any other menu I can think of around town. To top things off, the ice box pie: lemony, frozen, goodness. 

Downside is that it's cash only, but considering that two of us got fancy beers (Delirium!) an app, soup, two entrees and dessert for $53, I can handle it.",1
"2000",4,"The Painted Pin is a neat hangout place in Buckhead. There is an array of entertainment available - bowling, darts, ping pong, basketball, skee ball, shuffleboard, etc. It is a great place to grab drinks and chill with friends. However, if you want to bowl during peak hours, be prepared to wait. They don't take reservations.

Food, drinks, and ambiance are all great, but there are two things I don't like about The Painted Pin - parking and seating. 

Parking - There are a few free 2-hour street parking is available on Miami Circle, but if you're visiting during peak hours, they probably won't be free. Your only remaining options are valet or parking at the Buckhead Crossing Shopping Center and walking to Painted Pin (for the cheap-o's like me). If you park in the nearby lots, there is a high chance that your car will get booted. Up to you on whether you want to take the risk.

Seating - Seating is also difficult during peak hours. It is first-come first-served, so you might need to stake out and wait for a group to leave their table. Otherwise, you can stand around the bar or anywhere around the venue. If you only plan to drink, it's not really a problem.

Now that I've complained, I'll get onto the good parts - food and drink. I have tried a good number of menu items at The Painted Pin. Below is the list of items that I recall (in order of tastiness):
 
Drink: They have a strong beer, wine and cocktail menu, but I prefer cocktails.
- Bee's Knees: This is one of my favorite cocktails in general. Very light and not too sweet. Highly recommend it to anyone who likes gin and tea.
- Bourbon Punch (bowl): The bowl wasn't as big as we expected. I think maybe 2 or 3 people finished it off within minutes. It did taste great though. Slightly sweeter and stronger than the Bee's Knees.
- Old Fashioned: Standard old fashioned. No praises and no complaints.

Food: They offer a lot of small plates that can be shared by a group. Some items are great and some are meh. Any of their pizzas are a safe choice.
- Buckhead Betty Pizza: My favorite pizza at The Painted Pin. Topped with spinach, garlic, mushrooms, ricotta, and mozzarella, it is delicious! I always steer toward ""supreme"" pizzas, and this one has a good array of veggie toppings (also accommodates the vegetarians in your group).
- Margherita Pizza: Don't underestimate the simple margherita pizza. Their version has some chili flakes on top to add a small kick. My (large) group destroyed about 3 of these pizzas.
- The Pin Burger: Basically an overpriced Big Mac. It clearly tastes like a Big Mac, which isn't necessarily a bad thing (I love Big Macs). If you want a burger and don't have the patience to grab one at McDonald's later in the day, order this to satisfy your cravings.
- Pin Fries, House Pretzel Bites, & Hummus: All pretty standard and A-OK. Good plates to share with a group.
- Fried Calamari Pizza: My least favorite pizza. I love calamari, and I love pizza, but I don't think I like pizza with calamari. Basically just calamari thrown on top of a pizza. Seems unnecessary. It doesn't really add anything. It's not bad, but it's not that great either.
- Blackened Mahi Tacos: Decent fish tacos with enough flavor, but not the best fish tacos. Good enough for a non-Mexican / non-Tex/Mex restaurant.
- Fried Chicken Tacos: Very meh. The apples are a nice touch, but the taco felt very dry (mostly from the fried chicken). I think better chicken would improve the quality of these tacos.
- TPP Sliders: Basically sliders stacked with pimento cheese. I found them too salty with not enough bacon bits. If you love pimento cheese, go for it. Otherwise, I recommend passing.
- Waffle Dogs: Mini dogs wrapped in waffle. That's great in all, but their sauce is terrible. The sauce is savory (and not a maple syrup as one might expect). Very bad choice in the accompanying sauce. It might otherwise be okay.",1
